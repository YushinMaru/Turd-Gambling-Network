## Context
This document provides comprehensive documentation of Frederick "Fred" Turd's personal residence, commonly known as the "Zombie-Proof Mansion." Far more than a mere dwelling, this facility represents the physical manifestation of Fred's paranoia, technological innovation, and personal obsessions. The mansion serves multiple functions: secure personal residence, defensive fortress, private research facility, and symbolic statement of Fred's position within Turd Bird Industries.
