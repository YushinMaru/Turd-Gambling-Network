# Fred Turd's Zombie-Proof Mansion - Floor Plans & Spatial Organization
**Edition #1.0.0 | Created: (NEUR-ARC-011) | Last Modified: (NEUR-ARC-011)**

> Previous: None (Initial Documentation)

## Context
This document provides detailed floor plans and spatial organization information for Frederick "Fred" Turd's zombie-proof mansion. These plans are considered confidential and represent the most comprehensive documentation of the facility's internal layout. Due to Fred's continuous modification of the mansion and the architect's inclusion of rooms unknown even to Fred, these plans should be considered approximately 94% accurate at time of documentation.

## Access & Circulation Overview

### General Circulation Philosophy
The mansion's circulation system follows a defensive philosophy based on controlled access, redundant pathways, and strategic compartmentalization:

- **Concentric Security Rings:** Access becomes increasingly restricted moving toward center
- **Redundant Pathways:** Multiple routes connect critical areas for emergency situations
- **Specialized Transit Systems:** Dedicated movement systems for emergency situations
- **Security Checkpoints:** Strategic verification points at key transition areas
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Certain circulation paths can be modified during security events
- **Threat Response Integration:** Circulation design supports automated threat management
- **Psychological Calibration:** Path design incorporates psychological manipulation elements
- **Clone Management:** Certain pathways designed to prevent specific clone interactions
