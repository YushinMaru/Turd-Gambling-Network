## Context
This document details the unique relationship between the Pentagon and Turd Bird Industries regarding the Weaponized Kitchenware program. From its controversial beginnings to its current status as a classified procurement category, this partnership represents one of the most unusual defense acquisition programs in recent history.

## Program Origins

### Presidential Technology Committee (1992)
The conceptual seeds for Weaponized Kitchenware were planted during Fred Turd's brief and tumultuous appointment to a presidential technology advisory committee focused on unconventional defense innovations. Committee transcripts reveal:

- Initial proposal labeled "Alternative Configuration Everyday Objects" (ACEO)
- Fred Turd's suggestion that "common dining implements represent an overlooked tactical resource"
- Immediate dismissal by committee chairman as "frivolous and inappropriate"
- Fred's infamous rebuttal: "Your lack of imagination is a greater threat to national security than any foreign power"
- Formal removal from committee following unauthorized presentation of prototype "tactical napkin"

Fred's departure memo, later leaked to defense journalists, stated: "While you continue debating conventional approaches, I'll be developing the cutlery that will win the next war."

### Skunkworks Development (1992-1994)
Following his committee dismissal, Fred established a secret development team within Turd Bird Industries:

- Team codenamed "Dinner Party" operating in isolated facility
- Initial funding from Fred's personal resources (~$7.2 million)
- Recruitment of metallurgists and materials scientists from defense industry
- Parallel development of both concepts and functional prototypes
