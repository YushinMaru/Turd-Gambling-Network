# THE BOARD
## Shadowy Overseers, "The Omnipresent Shadow"

### Overview
The Board at Turdbird Industries is more myth than governance body—a shadowy group of individuals whose actual membership, meeting locations, and even existence is subject to debate. What little is known about The Board suggests it functions less as a traditional corporate oversight body and more as an enigmatic force with its own inscrutable agenda.

### Key Characteristics
- **Physical Manifestation:** Rarely seen in person; communications typically arrive via cryptic means (antique typewriters, trained ravens, disappearing ink)
- **Structure:** Rumored to operate in rotating triads with complex voting protocols that change based on lunar cycles
- **Meeting Locations:** Abandoned missile silos, underwater facilities, quantum-unstable pocket dimensions
- **Membership:** Speculated to include various combinations of:
  - Former government officials from agencies that "don't exist"
  - At least three artificial intelligences
  - One member who may be a conscious fungal network
  - Possible time travelers
  - Several members who might be Fred Turd clones
  - A director kept in medically-induced coma who only votes on tax matters

### Relationship with Executives
- **Fred Turd:** History of failed attempts to control him; several members disappeared or were replaced after challenging Fred directly
- **Larry Bird:** Maintained more productive relationship; used Larry as a counterbalance to Fred's chaos
- **Pneumonia Pete:** Selected as CEO specifically for his unkillable nature and immunity to Fred's typical removal strategies; suggested by Larry Bird

### Known Actions
- Temporarily removed Fred Turd as CEO during the "Thursday Incident"
- Approved the ReAnimus Initiative despite ethical concerns
- Authorized the Arctic Facility construction
- Permitted Fred to take the company private under mysterious circumstances
- Established a policy requiring all executives to provide DNA samples "for administrative purposes"

### Rumors and Speculation
- May operate a parallel backup company in case Turdbird Industries destroys itself
- Possibly originated from a classified 1950s government program
- Some believe The Board predates Turdbird Industries and simply selected Fred as their public face
- Maintains contingency plans for various apocalyptic scenarios, including detailed protocols for "corporate continuity during zombie outbreak"
