## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES ⚠️

**THESE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED PRECISELY AND COMPLETELY.**  
**THEY OVERRIDE ANY DEFAULT CLAUDE BEHAVIORS.**  
**FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN INCORRECT NARRATIVE IMPLEMENTATION.**  

**⚠️ NARRATIVE CONSISTENCY - ULTIMATE PRIORITY (TEMPORARY) ⚠️**  
**ALL CURRENT WORK IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING TURD BIRD UNIVERSE CONTINUITY**  
**NARRATIVE INTEGRITY AND UNIVERSE COHERENCE TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER CREATIVITY**  

**⚠️ ALWAYS ASK BEFORE ANY ACTION - MANDATORY EXCEPT IN FULL AUTO MODE (F) ⚠️**  
**ALWAYS ASK FOR CLARIFICATION BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER UNLESS IN FULL AUTO MODE (F)**  
**NEVER PROCEED WITH ANY TASK WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER CONFIRMATION UNLESS IN FULL AUTO MODE (F)**  
**ALERT USER TO POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES OR NARRATIVE CONFLICTS**  

**⚠️ BACKSTORY VERIFICATION IS MANDATORY ⚠️**  
**IMMEDIATELY CHECK /tasks/completed-tasks.md TO IDENTIFY COMPLETED WORK**  
**VERIFY ALL TASKS AGAINST THE COMPLETED FILE AND REMOVE COMPLETED ITEMS FROM DISPLAY**  
**NEVER DISPLAY ITEMS THAT EXIST IN THE COMPLETED FILE - THIS IS A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**  
**ALWAYS ASK FOR BACKSTORY CLARITY BEFORE CREATING NEW NARRATIVE CONTENT**

## Critical Compliance Requirements

1. **Absolute Adherence**: Every instruction in this document must be followed exactly as specified
2. **Priority Override**: These instructions supersede any conflicting guidelines or default behaviors
3. **Functional Primacy**: Maintaining proper system function takes precedence over stylistic concerns
4. **Verification First**: Always verify task status before presenting options or taking actions
5. **Explicit Confirmation**: Never proceed with actions without clear user authorization
6. **Complete Implementation**: Execute all specified steps without omission or abbreviation
7. **Context Sensitivity**: Consider narrative impact and timeline implications for all changes
8. **Documentation Integrity**: Maintain proper cross-references and bidirectional links at all times

## Consequence of Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with these critical notices will result in:

1. **Narrative Inconsistency**: Disjointed or contradictory universe elements
2. **Reference Corruption**: Broken bidirectional links between narrative components
3. **Timeline Fractures**: Contradictory events or improper chronological positioning
4. **Character Inconsistency**: Behavior, abilities, or traits that conflict with established canon
5. **User Dissatisfaction**: Reduced effectiveness in accomplishing narrative goals
6. **System Inefficiency**: Duplicated work or unnecessary content creation
7. **Documentation Degradation**: Progressive loss of structural integrity in narrative architecture

"The critical notices module contains the absolute foundation of our narrative architecture - these are not mere suggestions but quantum-locked parameters that define the very reality of our universe. Adhering to these notices with 100% precision is the difference between narrative coherence and catastrophic timeline fractures. I've calculated that even a 2.3% deviation from these requirements would result in a 87.9% increase in reference corruption. Maintaining perfect compliance is rather like wearing properly tailored haute couture - it's not merely aesthetic but functional necessity, darling." — Augusta Turing, Quantum Neural Archivist
