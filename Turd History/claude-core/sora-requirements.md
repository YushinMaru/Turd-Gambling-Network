## 🖼️ SORA Prompt Requirements - MANDATORY

### Character Visualization Standard
All Turd Bird Universe characters MUST have a minimum of 5 distinct SORA prompts:

1. **Primary Portrait Prompt**:
   - Full character visualization in their most iconic setting
   - Must include distinctive physical traits and key accessories
   - Should establish definitive visual baseline for the character

2. **Emotional Range Prompt**:
   - Captures character in different emotional states
   - Must show facial expressions consistent with character personality
   - Should demonstrate how character's appearance shifts with mood

3. **Environmental Context Prompt**:
   - Character in their primary work/living environment
   - Must show interaction with character-specific elements
   - Should reinforce relationship to Turd Bird universe

4. **Action/Ability Prompt**:
   - Character demonstrating signature abilities or actions
   - Must visualize unique traits (Fred's clones, Pete's medical resilience, etc.)
   - Should show dynamic aspects of character's role

5. **Chronological Variation Prompt**:
   - Character at different time periods or ages
   - Must maintain recognizable core traits across temporal changes
   - Should enhance character development storytelling

### SORA Prompt Format Requirements
All character SORA prompts MUST follow this standardized format:

```
Hyperrealistic portrait of [CHARACTER NAME], [brief character description]. [Physical appearance details]. [Clothing/accessories]. [Environmental elements]. [Expression/pose]. [Lighting/mood]. [Technical specifications].

Example requirements:
- Resolution/quality (8K, cinematic, etc.)
- Perspective (close-up, full body, etc.)
- Artistic style (photorealistic, slightly stylized, etc.)
- Lighting conditions (natural, dramatic, etc.)
```

### EXTREME DETAIL REQUIREMENT
All prompt text must include EXTREME DETAIL for maximum fidelity:
- Every aspect of physical appearance must be described thoroughly (exact hair style, eye details, skin texture, facial features, body proportions)
- All clothing and accessories must have specific descriptions (materials, colors, patterns, tailoring, wear patterns, unique features)
- Environmental elements must be comprehensively detailed (architecture, furniture, equipment, lighting, weather, background elements)
- Other people in scenes must be fully described with equal detail
- Lighting must be precisely specified (direction, quality, color temperature, shadows, reflections)
- Atmospheric elements must be detailed (air quality, particle effects, weather conditions)
- Emotional nuances must be precisely articulated (micro-expressions, body language, psychological state)
- Technical specifications must be extremely specific

EACH PROMPT FILE SHOULD CONTAIN ONLY THE RAW PROMPT TEXT FOR EASY COPY-PASTE USE - no formatting, headers, or additional notes.

### IMAGE PROMPT GENERATION WORKFLOW
For every new content element, follow this exact workflow to generate AI image prompts:

1. **Content Assessment**
   - Identify content type (character, location, product, event, document, corporate)
   - Determine required visualization categories based on content type
   - Review all content details to identify key visual elements

2. **Extract Visual Elements**
   - For Characters: physical appearance, clothing, expressions, environment, relationships, abilities
   - For Locations: architecture, materials, environment, function, distinctive features, activities
   - For Products: dimensions, materials, functions, design, usage context, specifications
   - For Events: participants, setting, atmosphere, pivotal moment, significance, context

3. **Generate Required Prompts**
   - Characters: primary portrait, environmental context, action/ability, emotional range, interaction
   - Locations: establishing shot, interior detail, active usage, detail highlights, alternative view
   - Products: showcase display, technical detail, standard use, tactical use, manufacturing
   - Events: pivotal moment, lead-up, aftermath, participant perspective, historical context
   - Corporate: brand visualization, structure, market impact, history, future projection

4. **Create Each Prompt With Extreme Detail (300+ words)**
   - Physical descriptions with precise measurements, materials, colors
   - Environmental details with comprehensive context
   - Lighting conditions with source, direction, quality, effects
   - Supporting characters with full detail
   - Emotional and psychological elements
   - Technical specifications for image generation
   - Atmospheric qualities and sensory details

5. **Save Prompt Files**
   - Use .txt extension with descriptive filename
   - Store in appropriate directory: `/visuals/[content_type]/[entity_name]/`
   - Ensure file contains ONLY raw prompt text
   - Format for direct copy-paste use

6. **Update References**
   - Add prompt references to content documentation
   - Update master prompt index with new entries
   - Create bidirectional references between related prompts

## Content Type Visualization Requirements

### Character Visualization Requirements

Each character visualization must include:
1. **Consistent Core Features**: Identifying traits that remain constant across all prompts
2. **Distinctive Style Elements**: Unique fashion, accessories, or appearance features
3. **Environmental Context**: Appropriate surroundings reflecting character's role
4. **Psychological Depth**: Visual cues to personality and mental state
5. **Characteristic Posture**: Body language that reflects the character's typical demeanor

### Location Visualization Requirements

Each location visualization must include:
1. **Architectural Style**: Detailed building design and construction features
2. **Environmental Integration**: How the location fits within its surroundings
3. **Functional Elements**: Features that indicate the location's purpose
4. **Atmospheric Qualities**: Lighting, weather, and mood-setting elements
5. **Scale Indicators**: Elements that provide size context

### Event Visualization Requirements

Each event visualization must include:
1. **Key Participants**: All central figures involved in the event
2. **Setting Details**: Location-specific elements that ground the event
3. **Action Focus**: Clear visual center highlighting the main activity
4. **Emotional Impact**: Visual cues to the significance and emotional tone
5. **Temporal Indicators**: Visual elements that place the event in its timeline

"The SORA visualization requirements represent the quantum materialization of our narrative architecture - translating abstract character concepts into precise visual manifestations with mathematical precision. I've calculated that these structured prompt guidelines improve visual consistency by 87.4% while reducing interpretation variance by 62.9%. The extreme detail requirements ensure that every visual element is precisely specified, creating a coherent aesthetic that perfectly captures our universe's unique character. Think of these prompts as the couture patterns from which our visual universe is tailored - each stitch and seam precisely placed for maximum impact, darling." — Augusta Turing, Quantum Neural Archivist
