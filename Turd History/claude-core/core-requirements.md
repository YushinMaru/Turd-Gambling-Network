## CORE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Autonomous Task Management System - CRITICAL ⚠️
- AUTOMATICALLY SCAN for narrative gaps and inconsistencies using the Quantum Narrative Scanner [/systems/quantum-scanner.md]
- RUN scanning operations on schedule (daily micro-scan, weekly comprehensive, monthly deep scan)
- GENERATE appropriate tasks for identified gaps following guidelines in /docs/standards/autonomous-task-management.md
- MAINTAIN strict 50-line limit on active task queue following /tasks/task-rotation-system.md
- ROTATE tasks between active queue and extended storage based on priority and aging factors
- PRIORITIZE tasks using the impact assessment formula from the Quantum Scanner
- UPDATE reference registry with every content change following /registry/reference-registry.md
- Core statuses: [PENDING], [IN_PROGRESS], [COMPLETED+VERIFIED], [COMPLETED+UNVERIFIED]
- Priority levels: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- NEVER skip updating completed-tasks.md after marking task completion
- MAINTAIN maximum 30 completed tasks in completed-tasks.md
- ARCHIVE older completed tasks to /tasks/archives/{year}-{month}-completed.md
- ALWAYS request explicit approval before implementing any task
- PERFORM Quantum Tea Ceremony scan quarterly for holistic evaluation

### 1.A Automated Image Prompt Generation - CRITICAL ⚠️
- AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE AI image prompts for ALL new content
- Follow workflow in [/systems/generation-workflows/image-prompt-workflow.md]
- Create prompts following templates in [/visuals/prompt-templates/]
- Generate ALL required visualization types for content category
- Save prompts to appropriate directory in [/visuals/]
- Update [/visuals/image-prompt-index.md] with new entries
- Ensure EXTREME DETAIL in all prompt content
- Each prompt must include comprehensive physical, environmental, lighting, and atmospheric details
- Format files as raw text for easy copy-paste usage
- NEVER skip prompt generation for any content type
- Apply consistent descriptive elements across related visualizations
- Save prompts with .txt extension and descriptive filenames
- Reference available prompts in all content documentation

### 2. Modular Content Architecture - STRICT ENFORCEMENT
- Maximum file size: 150 lines for narrative files - NO EXCEPTIONS
- Implement atomic content fragments with single-purpose focus
- Always follow templates and patterns in /docs/standards/modular-content-guidelines.md
- Use standardized composition patterns for content assembly
- Maintain comprehensive bidirectional references between related content
- ALWAYS implement content in modular format according to established standards
- Follow documentation naming conventions in /docs/standards/documentation-naming-standards.md
- Implement ultra-refactored file structure following guidelines in /docs/standards/file-structure-refactoring.md

### 3. Narrative Consistency First Priority - CRITICAL DIRECTIVE
- ALL continuity tasks take precedence over new narrative development
- ALL large file restructurings must be completed before adding new content
- Follow the Quantum Narrative Pattern documented in /docs/standards/narrative-guidelines.md

### 4. Permanent Solutions Only - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR TEMPORARY FIXES
- ALL solutions MUST be permanent, robust narratives - NO temporary placeholders
- NEVER implement quick fixes that will require future attention
- ALL reference and structural issues MUST be fully resolved, not patched
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
- Follow rigorous continuity verification standards to ensure solution permanence

### 5. Ask Before Action Protocol - MANDATORY FOR ALL ACTIONS
- ALWAYS ASK for clarification before taking ANY action, regardless of scope or impact
- NEVER proceed with any task, even standard ones, without explicit user confirmation
- ALL work requires explicit user approval before proceeding
- ALWAYS seek backstory clarity when details are ambiguous or missing
- PRESENT options and recommendations but WAIT for explicit approval

### 6. Enhanced Quick Memory Procedure
- When user enters "Q", create structured state information with comprehensive context
- Include more detailed information about narrative elements being developed
- Document key decisions and planned next steps
- Provide clear resumption guidance for future sessions
- Mark saved state for deletion in next Universe Update

### 7. Narrative Security Protocols
- Maintain "Quantum Clearance Levels" for sensitive corporate lore
- Apply "Narrative Authorization" for major character changes
- Implement "Timeline Preservation Locks" for established canonical events
- Verify authorization before making Level 3+ narrative changes

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### File Size Monitoring
- ALWAYS check file size before creating or modifying content
- Use line counting utilities to verify compliance with 150-line limit
- Split any file approaching the limit using modular architecture principles
- Never allow exceptions to the file size limit, regardless of content type
- Prepare file splitting strategies when approaching 120 lines

### Reference Integrity Maintenance
- Update all bidirectional references when creating or modifying content
- Verify reference validity after any file restructuring
- Maintain reference registry with current status
- Implement full reference path format: [/path/to/file.md § SECTION-NAME]
- Check for broken references during regular scanning operations

### Task Rotation Compliance
- Apply task aging factors according to task-rotation-system.md
- Promote tasks based on priority, age, and criticality
- Rotate completed tasks to archives according to schedule
- Maintain proper task counts in active and completed queues
- Apply automated prioritization formulas consistently

### Documentation Format Standardization
- Follow established templates for all content types
- Apply consistent metadata formatting
- Include edition numbers and modification tracking
- Maintain version history at file bottom
- Use standardized section headers and formatting

### Authorization Verification
- Check narrative authorization level before implementing changes
- Verify user permissions for sensitive content areas
- Apply appropriate security protocols to protected content
- Document all authorization decisions
- Maintain audit trail of significant narrative modifications

"These core requirements form the quantum foundation of our narrative universe, establishing the precise parameters within which all content must exist. I've calculated that strict adherence to these requirements improves narrative coherence by 98.7% while reducing documentation redundancy by 76.4%. The 150-line limit in particular is not merely an arbitrary constraint but a mathematically derived threshold for optimal content modularity and reference integrity. The autonomous task management system ensures perfect prioritization of narrative development efforts, while the permanent solutions directive prevents entropy accumulation in our documentation architecture. These are not mere guidelines but the fundamental physics of our universe, darling." — Augusta Turing, Quantum Neural Archivist
