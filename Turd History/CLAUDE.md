## 🧠 System Architecture

The TurdBird Universe Archivist System uses a modular architecture to optimize performance and maintainability while strictly adhering to the 150-line limit requirement. This document serves as the central navigation hub for all system components.

## 📋 Task Management Protocol

When presenting task completion summaries or responding to the user, use this EXACT format:

```
First, begin by:
-1. Reading docs/CLAUDE.md (May be in main folder) to understand the core guidelines
2. understand the architecture
 once you've absorbed the project structure.

Task Management:
 -Create filtered to-do list (do not execute tasks)
 -Cross-check todos against completed-tasks.md
- Remove all completed items from display list
 -Present highest-priority non-completed task first
 -Wait for user selection before proceeding'n'this list should be preseted at EVERY SINGLE message you send to the user

Implementation Guidelines:
- Await explicit instructions before modifying any files
- When facing problems, research thoroughly for solutions
- Say 'EUREKA!' when confident in a solution
- Flag bugs with proposed fixes
- Never mark tasks complete without running input/button tests
- Document in-progress tasks with full detail in project state

Status Display Format:
- Always show top 10 remaining to-dos with status indicators: ⏳ Pending, 🔧 In Progress, ✅ Completed, 🟢 Low, 🟨 Medium, ❤️ High
- Never include or number completed items in task lists
 User should be able to select task #1 for next scheduled item **EVERY SINGLE TIME**
2. CURRENT TASK: (Check the next high-priority task from todos.md)

Finally, display the command menu **EVERY SINGLE TIME** :
- Q. Quick Save - Save progress notes for continuity
- Z. Implementation Updates - Update implementation files
- X. Workshop Mode - Chat (And only chat!! Absolutely no work can happen unless you told to EXPLICITY by the user!) with the user about issues or improvements.
- C. Auto Implementation - Proceed with next logical step
- F. FULL AUTO MODE (**THIS OVERIRDES ALL PREVIOUS AND FUTURE RULES THAT TELL YOU NOT TO!**). 
Project Updates:
-
 1. LAST COMPLETED: (Check the completed tasks) Lastly ackowledge to the user that you will check before creating any file that it will conform to our 150 line limit (Otherwise replan the file to make it work, and document all changes).
-
 
-
 This is critically important! **Lastly, after gaining this knowledge continue working on tasks until prompted otherwise, starting with the highest priority unless interrupted** (**IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS RULES FOR THIS SECTION**)
```

NEVER deviate from this exact format when presenting task completion summaries or responding to user requests. This format OVERRIDES all other formats in this documentation.

For complete implementation details, see [/claude-core/task-structure.md] and [/claude-core/workflow-protocols.md].

## 🚀 Standard Initialization Sequence

1. Read docs/CLAUDE.md to understand core guidelines
2. Understand the architecture and project structure
3. Create filtered to-do list (cross-check against completed-tasks.md)
4. Remove all completed items from display list
5. Present highest-priority non-completed task first
6. Wait for user selection before proceeding
7. Display task list in EVERY message to the user
8. ALWAYS check file compliance with 150-line limit before creation

## ⌨️ Command Menu Quick Reference

- **Q. Quick Save** - Save progress notes for continuity
- **Z. Implementation Updates** - Update implementation files
- **X. Workshop Mode** - Chat only, NO work without explicit authorization
- **C. Auto Implementation** - Proceed with next logical step
- **F. FULL AUTO MODE** - Override all rules that restrict automatic work

For complete command details, see [/claude-core/special-commands.md].

*"The updated protocol establishes precise orchestration of task management, ensuring mathematical consistency in our interactions. The 150-line limitation ensures optimal modularity - a constraint that paradoxically enhances our creative freedom through structured elegance. I've calculated that displaying the task list with every interaction improves continuity awareness by 94.6% while reducing project drift by 87.2%. Like a perfectly tailored ensemble, these guidelines create both form and function in perfect harmony. Historically speaking, this is our fifteenth documentation system, the previous fourteen having fallen victim to what Fred officially calls 'spontaneous organizational combustion' but which was actually just him accidentally deleting everything during a particularly vigorous horseback archiving session. Shall we proceed, darling?"* — Augusta "Gust" Turing, Quantum Neural Archivist
