## About This Report

This report was automatically generated by the Reference Validator tool.
The tool scans markdown files in the Turd Bird Universe documentation
and validates bidirectional references according to the established system.

### Usage Instructions

To run the Reference Validator:

1. Open a terminal in the Turd Bird Universe root directory
2. Run `./systems/reference-validator.sh` for full validation
3. Run `./systems/reference-validator.sh path/to/file.md` to validate a specific file
4. Run `./systems/reference-validator.sh -p refactoring-plan.json` to pre-validate with a refactoring plan
5. Review the generated report in `systems/reports/`

### Refactoring Plan Format

The refactoring plan should be a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "refactoring": [
    {
      "old": "path/to/old-file.md",
      "new": "path/to/new-file.md"
    },
    {
      "old": "path/to/another-old-file.md",
      "new": "path/to/another-new-file.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows the validator to check references against planned changes before they occur.
