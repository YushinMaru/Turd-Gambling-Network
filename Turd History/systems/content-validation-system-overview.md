## Context

This document provides a high-level overview of the Turd Bird Universe Content Validation System, its components, implementation, and governance. The system ensures narrative consistency, character integrity, timeline continuity, relationship coherence, reference integrity, and stylistic consistency across all universe documentation.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

The Content Validation System consists of five integrated validation domains:

1. **Character Consistency Validation**

### Validation Integration Methods

Multiple integration approaches support different workflow needs:

1. **Progressive Validation**
