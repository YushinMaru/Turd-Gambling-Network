## Task Prioritization

The system assesses and prioritizes tasks based on these factors:

### Impact Assessment

  - Scope of narrative elements affected
  - Visibility of the inconsistency to readers
  - Cascading effects on dependent elements

- **Development Potential**
  - Value of the narrative enhancement
  - Storytelling opportunities created
  - Character depth contribution
  - World richness enhancement

- **Reference Integrity**
  - Importance to cross-reference system
  - Number of affected references
  - Severity of reference inconsistencies
  - Structural importance of affected elements

- **Universe Expansion**
  - Contribution to universe breadth
  - Addition of unique narrative elements
  - Extension of existing narrative threads
  - Opening of new narrative domains

### Priority Calculation

Tasks are assigned priority levels based on this formula:

```
Priority Score = (Continuity Impact × 3) + (Development Potential × 2) + 
                 (Reference Integrity × 2) + (Universe Expansion × 1)
```

Where each factor is rated 1-10 and final priority is assigned as:
- **HIGH:** Score 70-80
- **MEDIUM:** Score 40-69
- **LOW:** Score 10-39

### Queue Placement

Priority determines task placement in the system:

- **HIGH Priority:** Immediately added to active queue
- **MEDIUM Priority:** Added to active queue if space allows
- **LOW Priority:** Initially placed in extended storage

### Aging Factor

Tasks gain priority over time to prevent permanent deferral:

- **MEDIUM Priority:** +5 points after 2 weeks in extended storage
- **LOW Priority:** +3 points after 1 week, +5 points after 3 weeks
