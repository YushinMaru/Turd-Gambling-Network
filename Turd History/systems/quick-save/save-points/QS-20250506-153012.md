> Task: REFAC-003 - Apply Ultra-Refactored Structure to Pneumonia Pete Character Files
> Status: in_progress (35% complete)

## Narrative Context

This Quick Save captures the planned refactoring of Pneumonia Pete's pneumonia cases documentation. The current file character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases.md has 249 lines, exceeding the 150-line limit. The plan involves segmenting this content into multiple focused files while maintaining narrative coherence and reference integrity.

### Focal Elements
- **Characters:** Pneumonia Pete (Medical history documentation)
- **Timeline:** 1970s-Present (Covering all 92 pneumonia cases)
- **Developing:** Primary refactoring of Pete's medical documentation into a modular structure

### Key Decisions
- Create a dedicated `/characters/pneumonia-pete/medical/cases/` directory for segmented content
- Implement chronological segmentation by time periods and case numbers
- Maintain comprehensive cross-references between all segmented files
- Preserve all 92 pneumonia cases data while reorganizing for better accessibility
- Create an overview file that provides entry points to all segmented content

## Continuation Instructions

### Current Position
Completed analysis of the current file structure and content. Planning phase is complete with file segmentation strategy developed. Ready to begin implementation phase starting with directory creation.

### Next Steps
1. **Create new directory structure** - Create the `/characters/pneumonia-pete/medical/cases/` directory (estimated time: 5 minutes)
2. **Create overview file** - Develop `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-overview.md` containing high-level information, links to all segmented files, and the medical overview section (estimated time: 20 minutes)
3. **Create chronological segment files** - Develop separate files for each time period:
   - `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-childhood.md` for cases #1-20 (estimated time: 15 minutes)
   - `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-early-adulthood.md` for cases #21-40 (estimated time: 15 minutes)
   - `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-professional.md` for cases #41-70 (estimated time: 15 minutes)
   - `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-recent.md` for cases #71-92 (estimated time: 15 minutes)
4. **Create characteristics file** - Develop `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-characteristics.md` containing unique characteristics section (estimated time: 15 minutes)
5. **Create scientific significance file** - Develop `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-scientific.md` containing the scientific significance section (estimated time: 15 minutes)
6. **Create Turd Bird applications file** - Develop `character-pneumonia-pete-pneumonia-cases-applications.md` containing Turd Bird applications section (estimated time: 15 minutes)
7. **Update references** - Ensure all bidirectional references are updated across the entire character documentation (estimated time: 25 minutes)
8. **Verify implementation** - Test all references and links between segmented files (estimated time: 15 minutes)

### Creative Direction
Maintain the narrative tone and detail level of the original document while splitting into logical segments. Each segment should function as a standalone document while being clearly connected to the others through comprehensive bidirectional references. Ensure the segmentation enhances rather than diminishes the cohesive narrative of Pete's extraordinary medical history.
