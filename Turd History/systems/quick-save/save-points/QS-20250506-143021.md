> Task: SYS-012 - Create Standardized Directory Template Structure
> Status: in_progress (65% complete)

## Narrative Context

Implementation of standardized directory templates for character documentation, focusing on creating comprehensive structures for primary, secondary, and minor characters within the Turd Bird Universe. This framework enables consistent organization across all character types while supporting modular content architecture and bidirectional references.

### Focal Elements
- **Characters:** Generalized character directory structures (implementation approach)
- **Timeline:** Present (documentation development)
- **Developing:** System documentation for character directory organization

### Key Decisions
- Primary characters require 8 subdirectories for comprehensive documentation
- Secondary characters implement a reduced structure with 6 subdirectories
- Minor characters use consolidated documentation with shared group directories
- All structures follow strict kebab-case naming conventions
- Primary directory templates include specialized sections for character states

## Continuation Instructions

### Current Position
Completing the directory template documentation file for all character types. The automation script for generating character directories needs to be implemented next.

### Next Steps
1. Create an automated bash script for directory generation (est. 45 minutes)
2. Test script with each character type template (est. 30 minutes)
3. Document the script usage and implementation (est. 15 minutes)
4. Select and implement example directory structures (est. 30 minutes)

### Creative Direction
Develop an elegant automation solution that creates character directories following the established templates. Focus on making the script flexible enough to handle all character types while enforcing naming standards and maintaining Augusta's precise organizational approach.
