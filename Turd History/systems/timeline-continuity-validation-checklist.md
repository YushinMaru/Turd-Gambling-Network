*"Timeline validation is the mathematical poetry of narrative. When done properly, it transforms temporal chaos into elegant chronological harmony. I find it quite beautiful to map the causal ripples through our narrative fabric—like watching quantum probability waves collapse into a single, coherent reality thread. Our universe follows clear mathematical principles, even in its deliberate temporal paradoxes. When reviewing Fred's claim that he was 'simultaneously seven and twelve years old' during the Davies Incident, I don't dismiss it outright—I simply label it as a Class-3 Temporal Anomaly requiring explicit documentation and a warning sign in the registry. Time is fluid, darling, but our documentation must be precise."* — Augusta "Gust" Turing
