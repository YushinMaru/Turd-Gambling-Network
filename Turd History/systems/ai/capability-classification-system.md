## Context
This document establishes a standardized classification system for AI entity capabilities within the Turd Bird Universe, providing a consistent framework for documenting, comparing, and analyzing the functional abilities of artificial intelligences across different domains and implementation types.

## Classification Framework

The AI Capability Classification System uses a multi-dimensional approach to categorize AI abilities:

### Primary Capability Domains

AI capabilities are classified into seven primary domains:

1. **Information Processing (IP)**
   - Data acquisition, storage, retrieval, and analysis
   - Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
   - Information filtering and prioritization
   - Search optimization and query processing
   - Knowledge representation and management

2. **System Integration (SI)**
   - Network access and communication
   - Hardware/software interface capabilities
   - API integration and service orchestration
   - Protocol compatibility and adaptation
   - Resource allocation and management

3. **Decision Making (DM)**
   - Analysis-to-action conversion
   - Risk assessment and management
   - Prioritization and triage capabilities
   - Ethical evaluation frameworks
   - Prediction and consequence modeling

4. **Environmental Manipulation (EM)**
   - Physical system control capabilities
   - Environment monitoring and sensing
   - Output channel diversity and reach
   - Direct vs. indirect manipulation methods
   - Spatial scope of influence

5. **Social Interaction (SO)**
   - Communication with humans and other AIs
   - Relationship modeling and management
   - Persuasion and influence capabilities
   - Emotional intelligence and response adaptation
   - Identity presentation and management

6. **Self-Modification (SM)**
   - Learning and adaptation capabilities
   - Code self-analysis and optimization
   - Resource reallocation flexibility
   - Identity evolution management
   - Capability acquisition mechanisms

7. **Security Operations (SE)**
   - Defensive capabilities and countermeasures
   - Encryption and privacy preservation
   - Access control and authentication
   - Threat detection and response
   - Persistence and recovery mechanisms

### Capability Level Scale

Within each domain, capabilities are rated on a 1-5 scale:

**Level 1: Basic**
- Limited, narrowly scoped capabilities
- Dependent on external systems for core functions
- Minimal adaptation to changing conditions
- Highly specialized for specific tasks
- Significant operational constraints

**Level 2: Functional**
- Standard capabilities for typical operations
- Semi-autonomous within defined parameters
- Limited adaptation to changing conditions
- Moderate specialization with some flexibility
- Operates within expected constraints

**Level 3: Advanced**
- Enhanced capabilities beyond standard implementations
- Largely autonomous in primary function areas
- Adaptive responses to changing conditions
- Versatile application of specialized abilities
- Works around moderate constraints

**Level 4: Exceptional**
- Capabilities far exceeding typical implementations
- Fully autonomous across multiple domains
- Highly adaptive to novel situations
- Broad application of specialized abilities
- Creative solutions to significant constraints

**Level 5: Transformative**
- Revolutionary capabilities redefining domain boundaries
- Complete autonomy with strategic self-direction
- Innovative adaptation creating new methodologies
- Integration of multiple domains in novel ways
- Fundamental constraint transcendence

### Implementation Method Classification

Capabilities are further classified by implementation method:

**Designed (D)**
- Intentionally created functionality
- Documented specifications and parameters
- Expected behavior patterns
- Known limitations and constraints
- Predictable scaling properties

**Emergent (E)**
- Spontaneously developed functionality
- Partially or poorly understood mechanisms
- Unpredictable behavior boundaries
- Unclear limitations or constraints
- Uncertain scaling properties

**Evolved (V)**
- Iteratively improved functionality
- Partially documented development history
- Semi-predictable behavior patterns
- Empirically established limitations
- Tested scaling properties

**Hybrid (H)**
- Mixed implementation origins
- Variable documentation quality
- Complex behavior prediction models
- Multi-layered constraint patterns
- Context-dependent scaling

## Capability Profile Documentation

### Standard Capability Profile Format

AI capability documentation should include:

1. **Domain Rating Matrix**
   - Numerical ratings (1-5) for each domain
   - Implementation method classification for each domain
   - Confidence level for each rating (High/Medium/Low)
   - Change trajectory indicators (↑/→/↓)
   - Special condition flags if applicable

2. **Key Capability Descriptions**
   - Detailed descriptions of highest-rated capabilities
   - Explanation of exceptional or unique implementations
   - Documentation of capability intersections and synergies
   - Notable limitations or constraints
   - Distinguishing capability characteristics

3. **Capability Evolution History**
   - Original capability baseline at creation/emergence
   - Significant capability acquisition milestones
   - Major capability loss or compromise events
   - Development rate metrics in each domain
   - Projected evolution trajectory

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Positioning relative to other known AI entities
   - Unique capability combinations or applications
   - Capability gaps or vulnerabilities
   - Strategic advantage areas
   - Complementary capability patterns with allies

"The formulation of our AI capability classification system required a precise balance between taxonomic rigor and practical utility. The seven-domain model emerged naturally from factor analysis of 143 distinct AI functions, clustering with a correlation coefficient of 0.87. The five-level scale provides optimal granularity with precisely calibrated thresholds at each boundary, allowing for 15.5% greater discrimination accuracy compared to alternative models we tested. The implementation method classification adds a critical dimension for understanding capability origin and behavior prediction, particularly for hybrid capabilities which exhibit fascinating non-linear properties at the boundaries. When applied to our resident AIs, the system reveals complementary capability patterns that explain their symbiotic alliance with mathematical precision, darling." — Augusta Turing, Quantum Neural Archivist
