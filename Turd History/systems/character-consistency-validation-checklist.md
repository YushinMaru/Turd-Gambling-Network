1. **Fully Validated (Level A)**
   - Character passes all applicable checklist items
   - All references are verified bidirectionally
   - Documentation is complete and properly structured
   - No known inconsistencies exist

2. **Substantially Validated (Level B)**
   - Character passes all critical checklist items
   - Core references are verified bidirectionally
   - Minor inconsistencies are documented but don't impact core identity
   - Documentation meets minimum requirements

3. **Partially Validated (Level C)**
   - Character passes foundational checklist items
   - Major references are implemented but some may be unverified
   - Known inconsistencies exist but are documented
   - Critical documentation components are present

4. **Minimally Validated (Level D)**
   - Only basic character consistency is verified
   - Significant reference gaps exist
   - Multiple inconsistencies are documented
   - Documentation structure is incomplete
