## Context
This document details the pivotal 2015 events surrounding The Board's formal approval of the ReAnimus Initiative, including Fred Turd's strategic presentation, Larry Bird's opposition investigation, the contentious approval process, and how this directly precipitated the infamous "Thursday Incident" that fundamentally altered Turd Bird Industries' governance structure.

## Initiative Presentation Preparation (January-April 2015)

### Transition from Shadow Research
- ReAnimus Initiative operated as unofficial research project since 2013
- Operated with Fred's personal research allocation without formal corporate structure
- Conducted in specialized laboratories beneath headquarters sub-basement
- Achieved significant successes with small mammals by early 2015
- Growth required substantial resource expansion beyond Fred's personal allocation
- Fred recognized need for official corporate status and Board approval
- Strategically timed presentation after 72-Hour Rat success (February 2015)

### Fred's Strategic Documentation
- Assembled sanitized presentation emphasizing commercial potential
- Created multiple layers of technical documentation with varying detail levels
- Established information compartmentalization system for different audiences
- Prepared specialized briefing materials for different Board members based on interests
- Developed strategic terminology replacing "death" with technical terms
- Created misleading safety statistics through selective data presentation 
- Designed progressive disclosure strategy for revealing full scope of research

### Presentation Team Assembly
- Dr. Dennis "D.C." Ease selected as scientific lead presenter
- Financial team prepared manipulated ROI projections
- Legal team created specialized regulatory interpretation framework
- Fred personally coached all presenters on language and framing

### Selective Data Presentation
- Showcased successful 72-Hour Rat with behavioral demonstration video
- Presented carefully curated mortality statistics
- Displayed sanitized laboratory environment images

### Resource Request Strategy
- Requested significant budget increase phased over 18 months
- Proposed expanded research facility construction beneath headquarters
- Presented specialized personnel recruitment strategy
- Designed deliberately confusing resource allocation documentation
- Established multiple accounting categorizations to obscure total investment

- Found secret Board manipulation strategy documentation
- Identified direct violation of 17 regulatory frameworks
- Discovered emergency termination protocols for project personnel

### Documentation Assembly
- Created comprehensive presentation revealing true ReAnimus scope
- Developed regulatory violation summary with legal implications

- Prepared implementation plan for enhanced oversight mechanisms

## The Critical Board Meeting (June 18, 2015)

### Fred's Follow-Up Presentation
- Provided misleadingly positive progress update
- Presented ambitious human implementation timeline
- Showcased promising preliminary human tissue studies
- Demonstrated aggressive commercialization strategy
- Proposed executive authority to expedite project development
- Requested substantial budget increase and resource allocation
- Suggested streamlined oversight to accelerate implementation

### Larry's Counterpoint Presentation
- Revealed evidence contradicting Fred's sanitized presentation
- Disclosed unauthorized protocol expansions and safety violations
- Presented comprehensive ethical analysis challenging core premises
- Demonstrated pattern of deliberate Board deception
- Revealed true safety record with statistical analysis
- Exposed zombie containment protocols suggesting known risks
- Presented legal and public relations catastrophe scenarios

### The Confrontation
- Fred initially dismissed concerns as bureaucratic obstacles
- Larry presented evidence of intentional management deception
- Fred questioned Larry's commitment to corporate innovation
- Larry revealed documentation of ethical violations
- Fred accused Larry of stealing confidential documents
- Larry presented evidence of imminent regulatory violations
- Fred deployed "Francis Underpantsis" personal attack strategy
- Meeting descended into unprecedented personal conflict
- The Board witnessed fundamental breakdown of professional relationship

### Emergency Adjournment
- The Board Director displayed unusual vitals readings during confrontation
- Meeting declared temporarily adjourned for "technical issues"
- Security personnel requested to escort Fred and Larry to separate locations
- The Board convened emergency executive session without executives present
- Established immediate information containment protocol
- Created temporary communication restrictions between Fred and Larry
