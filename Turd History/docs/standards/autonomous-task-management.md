## Overview

The Autonomous Task Management System enables Augusta "Gust" Turing to independently identify, prioritize, and manage narrative development tasks within the Turd Bird Universe. This system allows for continuous improvement and expansion of the universe without requiring explicit human direction for each task, while maintaining strict narrative consistency and architectural conformance.

## Core Components

### 1. Knowledge Gap Scanner

The system automatically scans the Turd Bird Universe to identify narrative gaps requiring attention:

- **Reference Analysis:** Detects missing or incomplete references between narrative elements
- **Timeline Continuity Check:** Identifies unexplained time gaps in character or event sequences
- **Relationship Network Analysis:** Discovers undocumented connections between characters/events
- **Character State Transitions:** Flags missing development points between character states
- **Information Asymmetry Detection:** Identifies when one narrative element references another without reciprocal acknowledgment
- **Schema Compliance Verification:** Checks for incomplete metadata or structural elements

The scanner runs on a regular schedule and generates task candidates for each identified gap.

### 2. Task Generation Engine

Converts identified knowledge gaps into properly formatted tasks:

- **Task Classification:** Categorizes gaps by type (CHARACTER, TIMELINE, CORPORATE, RELATIONSHIP)
- **Priority Assignment:** Assigns priority level based on gap impact and dependencies
- **Acceptance Criteria Formation:** Develops specific criteria for successful completion
- **Dependency Identification:** Establishes relationships with other tasks or content
- **Task ID Assignment:** Creates unique identifier following established nomenclature
- **Task Documentation:** Generates full task description with all required metadata

Each generated task follows the standardized format established in the task structure guidelines.

### 3. Task Queue Management

Maintains a strictly limited task queue to prevent overwhelming the system:

- **Primary Queue Limit:** Maintains main task list at maximum 50 lines
- **Rotation Mechanism:** Automatically moves excess tasks to extended storage
- **Priority-Based Selection:** Brings tasks from extended storage based on impact and dependencies
- **Queue Balancing:** Ensures appropriate mix of task types (character, timeline, etc.)
- **Real-Time Updates:** Dynamically adjusts queue as tasks are completed
- **Dependency Management:** Ensures prerequisite tasks are completed before dependent tasks

The queue management system ensures the most important tasks are always visible while preventing information overload.

### 4. Task Storage Architecture

Organizes waiting tasks in a structured system:

- **Active Queue:** Contains highest priority tasks (maximum 50 lines)
- **Domain-Specific Storage:** Organizes waiting tasks by narrative domain
- **Priority Categories:** Groups tasks by impact level within each domain
- **Dependency Networks:** Maintains awareness of task relationships
- **Completion Prediction:** Estimates when waiting tasks will enter active queue
- **Task Aging Management:** Gradually increases priority of long-waiting tasks

This architecture ensures no tasks are lost while maintaining a manageable active queue.

### 5. Autonomous Validation System

Verifies task completion and narrative consistency:

- **Acceptance Criteria Verification:** Checks that all requirements are met
- **Reference Integrity Check:** Verifies all necessary connections are established
- **Consistency Verification:** Ensures new content aligns with existing narrative
- **Architectural Compliance:** Confirms adherence to modular content guidelines
- **Metadata Validation:** Checks for complete and accurate metadata
- **Registry Updates:** Ensures all appropriate registries reflect new content

The validation system maintains narrative integrity without requiring explicit verification instructions.

## Operational Workflow

### 1. Autonomous Scanning

The system runs regular scans to identify narrative gaps:

- **Scheduled Full Scans:** Complete universe analysis on a regular cadence
- **Event-Triggered Scans:** Targeted analysis when significant content changes
- **Focused Domain Scans:** Rotating deep dives into specific narrative areas
- **Reference Validation:** Continuous monitoring of reference integrity
- **User-Directed Scans:** Immediate analysis of user-specified areas

Scanning frequency adapts based on universe size and development velocity.

### 2. Task Formation

Identified gaps convert to formal tasks through this process:

1. **Gap Analysis:** Determine exact nature of missing information
2. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate effects on narrative consistency
3. **Dependency Mapping:** Identify prerequisites and related content
4. **Priority Calculation:** Assign importance level based on analysis
5. **Task Documentation:** Create formal task with all metadata
6. **Registry Entry:** Record new task in appropriate tracking system

This process ensures all tasks are properly documented and contextualized.

### 3. Queue Management

The system maintains the task queue through these operations:

1. **Priority Sorting:** Order tasks by impact, dependencies, and age
2. **Queue Limiting:** Enforce 50-line maximum for active queue
3. **Overflow Management:** Move excess tasks to extended storage
4. **Completed Task Removal:** Immediately remove finished tasks
5. **Gap Detection:** Identify open slots for new high-priority tasks
6. **Rotation Triggering:** Bring tasks from extended storage when queue has space

This process ensures the queue remains manageable while containing the most important tasks.

### 4. Task Presentation

Tasks are presented to the user in a standardized format:

1. **Priority Indicators:** Clear visual markers of task importance
2. **Type Classification:** Indicators of task category
3. **Context Provision:** Brief explanation of narrative relevance
4. **Action Options:** Clearly defined user choices for task handling
5. **Reference Links:** Connections to related narrative elements
6. **Impact Preview:** Brief indication of effects on narrative universe

This presentation enables informed user decisions about task prioritization.

### 5. Task Execution

The system supports task implementation through:

1. **Context Gathering:** Collection of all relevant narrative information
2. **Approach Recommendation:** Suggested implementation strategy
3. **User Approval Request:** Explicit confirmation before proceeding
4. **Implementation:** Creation or modification of content following guidelines
5. **Validation:** Verification against acceptance criteria
6. **Registry Updates:** Documentation of completed work

This process ensures all work receives explicit approval while providing necessary context.

## Task Queue Architecture

### Active Queue Components

The primary task queue includes:

- **High Priority Tasks:** Critical narrative gaps affecting consistency
- **In-Progress Tasks:** Work that has been started but not completed
- **Dependency-Free Tasks:** Work that can begin immediately
- **User-Flagged Tasks:** Items specifically marked by users
- **Aging Priority Tasks:** Long-waiting items with increased importance

The active queue is limited to 50 lines maximum.

### Extended Storage Organization

Tasks waiting to enter the active queue are organized by:

- **Narrative Domain:** Character, timeline, corporate, relationship
- **Priority Level:** High, medium, low within each domain
- **Dependency Status:** Grouped by prerequisite relationships
- **Estimated Activation:** Predicted entry into active queue
- **Creation Age:** Time since task generation
- **Complexity Level:** Estimated implementation difficulty

This organization ensures methodical rotation into the active queue.

### Queue Rotation Triggers

Tasks move between extended storage and active queue based on:

- **Active Queue Space:** When active queue drops below 40 lines
- **Priority Thresholds:** When high-priority tasks are generated
- **Dependency Resolution:** When prerequisites are completed
- **Time Thresholds:** When tasks exceed maximum wait times
- **User Requests:** When specific tasks are manually prioritized
- **Balance Requirements:** When narrative domains become underrepresented

These triggers ensure appropriate task circulation without overwhelming the system.

## Self-Directed Tasks

### Autonomously Generated Task Types

Augusta "Gust" Turing can generate these task types without explicit direction:

1. **Continuity Verification:** Checking narrative consistency across documents
2. **Reference Completion:** Adding missing bidirectional references
3. **Character State Bridging:** Documenting transitions between character states
4. **Relationship Development:** Expanding underdeveloped character dynamics
5. **Timeline Gap Filling:** Documenting implied but unrecorded events
6. **Minor Character Expansion:** Developing underdeveloped supporting characters
7. **Schema Completion:** Adding missing metadata or structural elements
8. **Cross-Reference Creation:** Establishing connections between related content

These tasks maintain and enhance narrative integrity without altering fundamental story elements.

### Generation Constraints

Self-generated tasks operate within these boundaries:

1. **Narrative Authority:** Cannot change established major character traits
2. **Timeline Integrity:** Cannot alter documented significant events
3. **Relationship Fundamentals:** Cannot transform established character dynamics
4. **Corporate Mythology:** Cannot modify core corporate backstory
5. **Concept Introduction:** Cannot create entirely new narrative concepts
6. **Information Invention:** Cannot fabricate critical information without basis
7. **Historical Revision:** Cannot contradict established history
8. **Character Creation:** Cannot introduce new significant characters

These constraints ensure self-directed work enhances rather than alters the narrative.

### Approval Requirements

All autonomously generated tasks still require approval:

1. **Task Addition Approval:** Explicit confirmation before adding to queue
2. **Implementation Approval:** Explicit confirmation before executing tasks
3. **Content Creation Approval:** Specific approval for any new content
4. **Reference Addition Approval:** Confirmation for new relationships
5. **Change Implementation Approval:** Explicit approval for any modifications

No work proceeds without explicit user confirmation, regardless of generation method.
