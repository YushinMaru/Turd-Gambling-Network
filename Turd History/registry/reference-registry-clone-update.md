## Reference ID Naming Conventions

Reference IDs follow the standardized format: `[SOURCE-TYPE]-[TARGET-TYPE]-[###]`

* **SOURCE-TYPE**: Content type of the reference source (CHAR, TIME, CORP, RELP)
* **TARGET-TYPE**: Content type of the reference target (CHAR, TIME, CORP, RELP)
* **###**: Sequential three-digit identifier within the source-target type pair

## Integration Instructions

These references should be added to the reference-registry.md file following the existing format and numbering conventions. Each entry should be placed in the appropriate section based on the source-target pairing.

After integration, run the reference validation script to ensure all new bidirectional references are properly established and validated.
