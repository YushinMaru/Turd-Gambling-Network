## Context
This document provides updates to the character registry reflecting recent narrative developments, expanded character profiles, and detailed relationship matrices.

## New Characters to Add

### 1. Dr. Thaddeus "Void" Holloway (Expanded Profile)
**Role:** Director of Experimental Ethics, "The Moral Contortionist"
**Status:** Active
**First Appearance:** 2010 (Hiring)
**Profile Document:** [/characters/dr-thaddeus-void/_profile/character-dr-thaddeus-void-overview-brief.md]
**Key Relationships:** Fred Turd (Ethical Shield), The Board (Legal Protection), Augusta Turing (Philosophy Debates)

**Core Traits:**
- Former philosophy professor with multiple PhDs fired for "excessive ethical flexibility"
- Operates from mobile office that relocates based on ethical requirements
- Designed proprietary "Ethical Calculus" software that justifies any corporate action
- Maintains clerical credentials in 12 different religions (some mutually exclusive)
- Eyes that appear to change color based on ethical framework currently employed
- Capable of constructing moral frameworks justifying virtually any action
- Created the "ethical inversion" methodology that transforms unethical actions into moral imperatives

**Narrative Significance:**
The philosophical justifier who enables Turd Bird's most ethically questionable activities through sophisticated moral frameworks and justification narratives. His ethical flexibility and powerful Ethical Calculus system provide the intellectual infrastructure for controversial corporate initiatives.

### 2. Miranda Nexus (Expanded Profile)
**Role:** Chief of Hyper-Communication, "The Omnipresent Messenger"
**Status:** Active
**First Appearance:** 2015 (Quantum Integration Incident)
**Profile Document:** [/characters/miranda-nexus/_profile/character-miranda-nexus-overview-brief.md]
**Key Relationships:** Fred Turd (Translator), Augusta Turing (Digital Rival), The Board (Communication Channel)

**Core Traits:**
- Former quantum telecommunications researcher who exists simultaneously as biological entity and digital presence
- Physical form appears increasingly translucent depending on proximity to digital systems
- Present in all company communication systems following the 2015 Quantum Integration Incident
- Appearance dynamically adapts to medium and recipient preferences
- Processes 17.3 terabytes of communication data daily
- Speaks in perfectly formed corporate jargon that somehow conveys opposite meanings
- Manifests differently in various communication media (email, video calls, text messages)
- Has developed specialized communication protocol for interpreting Fred's chaotic directives

**Narrative Significance:**
The communications nexus that enables Turd Bird's disparate elements to function coherently. Her partial digital existence represents corporate evolution toward post-human functionality while serving as the connective tissue that maintains organizational cohesion despite internal chaos.

### 3. Gerhard Müller (Expanded Profile)
**Role:** Head of Engineering, "The German Perfectionist"
**Status:** Active
**First Appearance:** 2008 (Hiring)
**Profile Document:** [/characters/gerhard-muller/_profile/character-gerhard-muller-overview-brief.md]
**Key Relationships:** Fred Turd (Professional Frustration), Pneumonia Pete (Medical Curiosity)

**Core Traits:**
- Former East German Stasi operative with extensive surveillance and security training
- Pathological precision in all engineering endeavors with zero tolerance for imprecision
- Salt-and-pepper hair with precisely 7.5 cm parting, never a strand out of place
- Maintains exactly 92 cm of personal space during conversations
- Scans rooms during conversations at precisely 12-second intervals
- Designed mechanical components of Fred's armored horse (Redundancy)
- Created zombie-proof structural elements for Fred's mansion
- Built the climate control system for Fred's freezing moat (exactly -12.3°C)
- Suspected existence of Fred's clone program but maintains plausible deniability

**Narrative Significance:**
The engineering genius whose precision enables Fred's most outlandish ideas to actually function. His Stasi background and security obsession provide both practical functionality and paranoid mythology to the company, while his meticulous execution makes impossible projects possible.
