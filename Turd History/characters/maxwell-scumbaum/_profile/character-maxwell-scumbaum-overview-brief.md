## Character Summary
Maxwell "Max" Scumbaum represents the worst aspects of tabloid journalism taken to extremes, serving as a narrative foil to the already morally questionable Turd Bird executives. His sleazy tactics, inappropriate behavior, and relentless pursuit of sensationalism create external pressure on the company while providing a warped lens through which the public views Turd Bird Industries. Despite his repulsive personality and ethical failures, his persistent investigation occasionally stumbles onto legitimate concerns, making him an unpredictable wildcard in the corporate landscape.

## Professional Significance
Scumbaum's show "Corporate Underbelly" commands a substantial audience despite (or because of) its questionable journalistic standards. His willingness to publish unverified claims and salacious rumors makes him both a nuisance and occasionally a useful tool for various factions within Turd Bird. His media presence creates a constant background pressure of public scrutiny, albeit distorted through his sensationalist lens. His professional rivalry with more legitimate journalists covering Turd Bird creates a complex media ecosystem around the company.

## Narrative Significance
As an external antagonist, Scumbaum serves multiple narrative functions: forcing characters to be more cautious about public exposure, providing comic relief through his outlandish theories, occasionally revealing or obscuring important information as a plot device, showing how Turd Bird is viewed by outside media, and making even the morally questionable Turd Bird executives seem reasonable by comparison. His interactions with various characters reveal different aspects of their personalities based on how they handle his harassment and intrusions.
