### Facial Features

- **Hygiene Decline:** Visible food stains appear, makeup smears, hair dishevels

## Physical Evolution

### Early Career (1990s)
- Fit, athletic build from college sports background
- Natural camera presence with minimal preparation
- Carefully maintained appearance with minimal artificial enhancement
- Professional demeanor both on and off camera

### Mid-Career (2000s)
- Gradual weight gain as lifestyle deteriorated
- Increasing reliance on artificial enhancements (hair dye, whitening)
- Development of distinct on/off camera personas
- Beginning of stress-related physical manifestations

### Current State (2010s-Present)
- Significant physical deterioration masked by increasing production techniques
- Heavy reliance on pre-interview "preparation" (stimulants, energy drinks)
- Post-production editing to conceal physical issues
- Increasing disconnect between public image and actual physical state

## Camera Equipment as Extension

### Signature Recording Devices
- Military-grade directional microphones (illegally modified)
- Multiple hidden cameras throughout clothing and accessories
- Drone surveillance equipment with facial recognition
- Signal interceptors disguised as standard journalist equipment

### Physical Interaction with Equipment
