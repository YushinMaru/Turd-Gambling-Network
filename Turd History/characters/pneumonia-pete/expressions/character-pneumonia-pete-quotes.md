## Mortality Perspective

### Death & Survival
- "Death and I have an understanding: it tries, I refuse."
- "I've died enough times to know it doesn't take."

- "My funeral has been planned and canceled more times than a government budget meeting."
- "Most people are afraid of dying. I'm more concerned about the inconvenience of the paperwork."

### Time Perspective

- "Long-term investments make me laugh. My long term is Thursday."
- "I experience time differently when you've had it stop completely twenty-seven times."

- "I measure life in breaths, not years. Makes the math more interesting."
- "Time is just the space between near-death experiences. Mine are just more condensed."
- "Immortality is overrated. Try scheduled mortality with cancellations."

## Medical Philosophy

### Illness & Treatment
- "My medical file requires its own server. That's not a joke."
- "Side effects are just features you weren't expecting."
- "The difference between poison and medicine is dosage and attitude."

- "Most people avoid germs. I evaluate them for character and potential."
- "Experimental treatments aren't risky when conventional treatments have already failed ninety times."

- "There's freedom in knowing the worst-case scenario is something you've already survived repeatedly."
- "I don't fear failure. I've failed biologically ninety-two times and I'm still here."

- "Most people avoid the edge. I've been falling off it regularly since childhood."
