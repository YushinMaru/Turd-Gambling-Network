## Perceptual Impact
Pete's physical appearance creates a cognitive dissonance in observers: his apparent fragility and distinctive blue coloration contrasts sharply with his demonstrated resilience and authority. His blue-tinged skin has become his most recognizable physical trait, making him instantly identifiable across a room. This contradiction between his corpse-like blue appearance and vibrant indestructibility contributes significantly to his intimidation factor, as people struggle to reconcile his seeming physical vulnerability with his demonstrated resilience. The blue coloration has become so synonymous with Pete that employees sometimes refer to particular shade as "Pneumonia Blue" in hushed conversations.

## Evolution Over Time

### Early Life (1970s-1980s)
- More conventionally healthy appearance despite early medical issues
- Gradual development of distinctive features through chronic illness
- Physical adaptations began forming during adolescence

### Mid Career (1990s-2010)
- Increasing visible effects of chronic illness
- Development of efficient energy conservation techniques
- Enhancement of striking contrast between apparent frailty and demonstrated strength

### Current (2020-Present)
- Most distinctive appearance phase with deepest blue coloration yet observed
- Blue skin tone has reached its most pronounced state (sometimes described as "cosmic blue")
- Physical manifestations of zombie virus immunity including unique blue pigmentation
- Subtle changes from ReAnimus Initiative participation enhancing blue undertones
- Peak contrast between corpse-like blue complexion and extraordinary resilience
- Blue coloration now permanent rather than fluctuating with illness phases

## Medical Documentation Note
Pete's physical appearance changes subtly with his current dominant condition. Medical staff have documented fluctuations in blue skin tone intensity, respiratory patterns, and energy levels corresponding to different disease phases. While his baseline blue coloration is now permanent, the exact shade and intensity fluctuate with his current dominant pneumonia strain. These variations occur within a consistent baseline of chronic illness indicators, with medical staff noting at least 27 distinct shades of blue they've documented in his skin tone over the years. The phenomenon has been officially termed "Pneumatic Chromatic Variation" in medical literature.
