## Character Summary
Pneumonia Pete represents the embodiment of resilience and persistence within the Turd Bird Universe. Characterized by his extraordinary ability to survive 92 documented cases of pneumonia, multiple clinical deaths, and his distinctive blue-tinged skin, Pete has evolved from experimental test subject to CEO through his unique perspective on mortality and risk. His corpse-like blue complexion (ranging from cobalt to "cosmic blue") has become his most recognizable physical trait, making him instantly identifiable across a room and earning the specific shade the nickname "Pneumonia Blue" among employees. His antagonistic relationship with Fred Turd and his central role in the ReAnimus Initiative place him at the heart of current corporate dynamics.

## Medical Significance
Pete's medical condition represents a scientific paradox - his constant illness has paradoxically made him stronger rather than weaker. The "Pneumonides Paradox" has been studied by multiple research universities, with his immune system classified as a "national resource." His distinctive blue skin coloration, officially termed "Pneumatic Chromatic Variation" in medical literature, has been documented in 27 different shades of blue that fluctuate with his current dominant pneumonia strain. His experiences with clinical death (27 documented instances) and subsequent reanimation have made him instrumental to Turd Bird's experimental medical research, with each death further intensifying his blue pigmentation.

## Corporate Significance
As current CEO, Pete maintains the company's chaotic trajectory while emphasizing "products for survivors." His appointment after Fred's temporary removal created a new power dynamic, resulting in profound animosity between the two figures. Despite this antagonism, their mutual opposition creates a productive tension driving innovation.
