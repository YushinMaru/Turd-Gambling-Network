## Context
This document provides a comprehensive overview of all 92 documented pneumonia cases experienced by Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian, establishing the organizational framework for detailed case documentation and analysis across multiple files.

## Complete Catalog Structure

### Catalog Organization
Pete's 92 documented pneumonia cases are organized into four distinct chronological periods:

1. **Childhood Period (Cases #1-20, 1970s-1980s)**
   - Initial discovery and documentation of unusual recovery capacity
   - Establishment of personification naming convention
   - Development of patient-directed treatment modifications
   - First evidence of the "Pneumonides Paradox"
   - [See detailed documentation in pneumonia-catalog-childhood-detail.md]

2. **Early Adulthood Period (Cases #21-40, 1985-1994)**
   - Transition to adult medical management
   - First specialized research protocols
   - Development of genetic testing regimen
   - Establishment of recovery pattern baselines
   - [See detailed documentation in cases/character-pneumonia-pete-cases-early-adult-detail.md]

3. **Professional Period (Cases #41-70, 1995-2009)**
   - Integration with Turd Bird Industries research
   - First corporate applications of recovery insights
   - Development of experimental treatment protocols
   - Increased clinical death incidents with faster recoveries
