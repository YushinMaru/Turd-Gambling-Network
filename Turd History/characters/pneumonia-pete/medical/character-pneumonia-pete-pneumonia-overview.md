## Context
This document provides an overview of Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian's 92 documented cases of pneumonia, which represent the core of his character identity. These cases have shaped his physical condition, personality, career trajectory, and unique role within Turd Bird Industries. This overview connects to detailed component documents covering different aspects of these cases.

## Medical Overview

### Unprecedented Survival Pattern
- 92 doctor-verified cases of pneumonia over 50+ years
- Only human in recorded medical history with pneumonia for 20 consecutive years
- Each pneumonia case verified by independent medical assessment
- Complete medical documentation maintained for research purposes
- Progressive adaptation pattern contrary to normal medical expectations
- Subject of numerous medical journal articles and case studies

### The Pneumonides Paradox
- Term coined by Dr. Elena Vasquez (Chicago Memorial Hospital)
- Describes unusual pattern of increasing resilience through repeated illness
- Directly contradicts standard medical understanding of cumulative damage
- Specific to Pete's unique physiological response to pneumonia
- Characterized by:
  - Increasing recovery speed with each exposure
  - Enhanced immune memory for specific pathogen variants
  - Adaptive pulmonary tissue response to repeated infection
  - Paradoxical strengthening of compromised systems
  - Improved oxygen efficiency in damaged lung tissue
  - Enhanced metabolic efficiency during illness states

### Medical Documentation
- Complete records maintained in three separate research repositories
- Comprehensive symptom mapping across all 92 cases
- Detailed immunological response tracking for each variant
- Genetic sequencing of all causal pathogens preserved
- Radiological history showing lung tissue evolution
- Blood and tissue samples preserved from each major case
