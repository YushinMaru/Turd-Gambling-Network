## Context
This document details pneumonia cases #71-92 experienced by Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian during his executive leadership and CEO tenure at Turd Bird Industries, where his condition became integrated with the ReAnimus Initiative.

## Recent Cases (Cases #71-92, 2010-Present)

### Late Career Evolution (Cases #71-85)
- Cases continued through executive leadership period
- Minimal operational impact despite clinical severity
- Developed methods for maintaining function during acute phases
- Created leadership contingency protocols for severe episodes
- Implemented enhanced recovery methodologies
- Established predictive models for onset and duration

### The Reanimation Era (Cases #86-92)
- Most recent cases occurring during CEO tenure
- Increasingly integrated with ReAnimus Initiative research
- Connection to zombie virus immunity discovery
- Implementation of experimental reanimation protocols during pneumonia
- Testing of consciousness preservation during acute episodes
- Application of enhanced recovery treatments from Initiative

### Current Status
- Most recent case (#92) occurred approximately 2 months ago
- Shortest recovery period yet recorded (8 days vs. standard 28-35)
- Enhanced lung function measured following recovery
- Correlation observed with zombie virus immunity factors
- Implementation of new monitoring technology during episode
- Development of predictive model for case #93

## Executive Functionality
- Established pneumonia-specific executive decision framework
- Created respiratory crisis leadership protocols
- Implemented voice-activated management systems for low-function periods
- Developed "proxy leadership" system during severe episodes
- Integrated pneumonia recovery stages into strategic planning
- Created executive resilience training based on pneumonia experiences

## Notable Cases
- Eliza (#74): "The Executive" - First case during executive leadership
- Timothy (#78): Documented through advanced monitoring systems
- Maxwell (#83): "The Revelator" - Case revealing zombie virus immunity
- Penelope (#89): First case integrated with ReAnimus experimental protocol
- Olivia (#92): "The Current" - Most recent case, showing shortest recovery
