- First identified as having "unusual recovery capacity"

### Developmental Pattern (Ages 5-16, Cases #2-20)
- Cases progressed from expected severity to unusual resilience
- Transition from standard to accelerated recovery timeline
- Development of personal symptom management techniques
- Established pattern of self-directed treatment modifications
- Created personal documentation methodology for tracking progress
- Beginning of "celebratory" approach to survival milestones

### Medical Significance
- First described in literature as "Sebastian Anomaly"
- Documented as medical curiosity rather than scientific focus
- Initially attributed to statistical anomaly or misdiagnosis
- Recognized as legitimate phenomenon by case #15
- Preserved samples later proved consistent diagnosis
- Established foundation for later research interest

## Psychological Development

- Developed interest in medical field through personal experience
- Created early version of pneumonia personification mythology
- Established comfort with hospital environments and procedures
