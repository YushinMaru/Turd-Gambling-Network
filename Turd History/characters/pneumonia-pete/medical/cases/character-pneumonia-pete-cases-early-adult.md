This document details pneumonia cases #21-40 experienced by Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian during his university education and early medical career, which transformed his relationship with his condition from patient to researcher.

## Early Adulthood (Cases #21-40, 1980s-1990s)

### University Period (Cases #21-35)
- Cases continued throughout undergraduate and medical education
- Developed academic interest in own condition
- Established self as both patient and researcher
- Created rigorous documentation protocol

- Began formal study of immune response patterns

### Medical Education Impact (Cases #36-40)
- Unique perspective as medical student with active condition
- Used own cases for educational demonstration
- Developed novel diagnostic approaches through personal experience
- Created detailed symptom quantification methodology
- Established early version of "Pneumonides Protocol"
- Began collaboration with immunology researchers

### Research Developments

- Initial studies of adaptive immune response pattern
- Preliminary mapping of genetic factors in survival
- First medical papers co-authored as patient-researcher
- Initial interest from immunology research community
- Development of early theories about mechanism

## Career Integration
- Pneumonia cases became central to professional identity
- Developed specialized expertise in respiratory resilience
- Built professional network through condition documentation
- Established professional credibility through data rigor
- Created framework for patient-researcher methodology
