## Context
This document details Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian's unique approach to coping with his condition through personification of each pneumonia case, which has become a defining aspect of his psychological relationship with his condition.

## Pneumonia Personification System

### Conceptual Framework
- Each pneumonia case individually named and personified
- Names typically follow alphabetical pattern with exceptions
- Personality attributes assigned to each manifestation
- Detailed "relationship" history maintained for each variant
- Communication style developed for addressing each type
- Elaborate mythology created around internal "ecosystem"

### Psychological Function
- Personification transforms passive experience into active relationship
- Creates sense of agency in management of condition
- Establishes familiar framework for unpredictable experiences
- Transforms medical trauma into narrative structure
- Allows for humor and detachment from life-threatening condition
- Creates vocabulary for discussing complex medical experiences

### Documentation Methodology
- Detailed journal entry created for each new pneumonia manifestation
- Formal "introduction" ritual for new cases
- "Exit interview" conducted during recovery phase
- Character sketch developed including personality traits
