## Context
This document provides the core distribution and duration analysis of all 92 documented pneumonia cases experienced by Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian, examining chronological patterns and recovery efficiency evolution across his lifetime of pneumonia incidents.

## Timeline Distribution Analysis

### Chronological Distribution
- **Childhood (1-20): 1974-1984**
  - Frequency: One case approximately every 6 months
  - Pattern: Relatively steady distribution throughout childhood
  - Notable clusters: Three cases in rapid succession during 1975-1976
  - Longest gap: 9 months between cases #11 and #12

- **Early Adulthood (21-40): 1985-1994**
  - Frequency: One case approximately every 6 months
  - Pattern: Maintained childhood frequency with increased predictability
  - Notable clusters: Five cases during college finals periods
  - Longest gap: 8 months between cases #28 and #29

- **Professional Period (41-70): 1995-2009**
  - Frequency: One case approximately every 5 months
  - Pattern: Slight increase in frequency with career development
  - Notable clusters: Three cases following Turd Bird employment
  - Longest gap: 7 months between cases #61 and #62

- **Recent Period (71-92): 2010-Present**
  - Frequency: One case approximately every 6 months
  - Pattern: Return to historical baseline frequency
  - Notable clusters: Four cases during ReAnimus Initiative development
  - Longest gap: 10 months between cases #87 and #88

### Seasonal Correlation
- Winter peak: 34 cases (37%) occurred during winter months
- Spring distribution: 22 cases (24%) occurred during spring months
- Summer minimum: 13 cases (14%) occurred during summer months
- Fall distribution: 23 cases (25%) occurred during fall months

### Event Correlation
- Corporate events: 17 cases occurred within 2 weeks of major corporate decisions
- Travel impact: 11 cases occurred during or immediately after business travel
- Stress correlation: 23 cases correlated with documented high-stress periods
- Research milestones: 9 cases preceded significant research breakthroughs

## Duration Evolution Analysis

### Average Duration by Period
- **Childhood (1-20): 39.6 days per case**
  - Longest: Case #17 (Reginald) at 212 days
  - Shortest: Case #13 (Julia) at 22 days
  - Standard deviation: 38.2 days

- **Early Adulthood (21-40): 34.2 days per case**
  - Longest: Case #31 (Alice) at 78 days
  - Shortest: Case #36 (Francis) at 19 days
  - Standard deviation: 15.6 days

- **Professional Period (41-70): 21.7 days per case**
  - Longest: Case #56 (Nathan) at 42 days
  - Shortest: Case #68 (Rebecca) at 12 days
  - Standard deviation: 8.2 days

- **Recent Period (71-92): 14.3 days per case**
  - Longest: Case #82 (Marcus) at 31 days
  - Shortest: Case #92 (Zachary) at 8 days
  - Standard deviation: 5.4 days

### Recovery Efficiency Progression
- Initial recovery rate: 1.68% per day (childhood period)
- Current recovery rate: 6.99% per day (recent period)
- Efficiency improvement: 416% increase in recovery speed
- Consistent acceleration pattern: 0.7% average annual improvement
