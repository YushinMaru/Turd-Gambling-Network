## Context
This document details the physical appearance and characteristics of Dr. Dennis "D.C." Ease, Chief Necrobiologist at Turd Bird Industries' ReAnimus Initiative. His distinctive physical attributes reflect both his professional environment and personal eccentricities, creating a visual presentation that reinforces his unsettling specialization in reanimation science.

## Physical Characteristics

### Basic Biometrics

**Age:** 47 (chronological), claims to be "chronologically fluid"  
**Height:** 6'2" (188 cm)  
**Weight:** 158 lbs (71.7 kg) - Consistently underweight  
**Build:** Lean, almost gaunt with pronounced clavicles  
**Posture:** Unusually erect, maintains perfect spine alignment  
**Blood Type:** AB Negative with rare Bombay phenotype (claims it's "optimal for experimental protocols")  
**Resting Heart Rate:** 42 BPM (significantly below average)  
**Body Temperature:** 96.4°F (35.8°C) - Consistently below normal  

### Distinctive Features

#### Complexion
Dr. Ease possesses an unnaturally pale complexion that borders on translucent, revealing a faint blue network of veins beneath the skin surface. This extreme pallor is the result of years working in climate-controlled underground laboratories with minimal exposure to natural light. Despite regular vitamin D supplementation, his skin maintains a marble-like quality that, combined with his slender build, creates an almost cadaverous appearance that unsettles new acquaintances.

#### Eyes
His most striking feature is pronounced heterochromia - his left eye is a piercing ice blue, while his right eye is amber with unusual gold flecks. The contrast is jarring and often draws attention during conversations. Dr. Ease claims the amber eye "died first" but offers no further explanation when questioned. His pupils react unusually slowly to light changes, and he blinks approximately 40% less frequently than the average person, contributing to his unnerving gaze.

#### Hair
Dr. Ease maintains meticulously groomed silver-white hair despite being only 47 years old. The premature coloration (apparent since his mid-30s) is cropped in a precision-cut style with exactly 2.7cm length maintained through weekly self-administered trims. The hairline is receding slightly at the temples in perfect symmetry, which he has commented is "aesthetically optimal" and refuses treatment options.

#### Hands
His hands feature unusually long, thin fingers with prominent knuckles and visible tendons. Fingernails are maintained at precisely 3mm length and are manicured weekly. His hands remain perfectly steady even during complex procedures, with dexterity tests placing him in the 99.7th percentile for fine motor control. There is a notable absence of natural lines on his palms, which appear unusually smooth.

#### Voice
Though not strictly a physical characteristic, Dr. Ease's voice is a distinctive aspect of his presentation. He speaks in a measured monotone with minimal inflection, regardless of conversational context. The voice maintains a consistent volume and cadence with an unusual resonance quality that some have described as "hollow." His accent contains subtle Eastern European elements but cannot be pinned to any specific region, leading to speculation about its authenticity.

### Physical Presentation

#### Attire
Dr. Ease adheres to a rigorous dress code of his own creation:

- Exclusively wears laboratory coats, maintaining a rotation of seven identical white coats
- Each coat features exactly fourteen buttons (standard coats modified to his specifications)
- Beneath lab coats, wears charcoal gray dress shirts with matching slacks
- Black Oxford shoes, polished to a specific reflectivity standard (measured weekly)
- No jewelry except for his antique pocket watch (see Personal Effects)
- Wears nitrile gloves at all times, even during non-laboratory activities
- Maintains spare clothing sets at precise locations throughout the facility

#### Grooming Habits
His grooming regimen is executed with scientific precision:

- Shaves twice daily at precisely 5:37 AM and 5:37 PM
- Applies unscented antimicrobial soap using a specific pattern of movements
- Measures and records hair length daily, trimming when it exceeds 2.7cm
- Uses specialized eye drops formulated to his specifications every 4 hours
- Applies SPF 100 sunscreen before any potential exposure to natural light
- Follows a 23-step oral hygiene protocol three times daily
- Records all biometric measurements (weight, heart rate, temperature) hourly

### Movement Patterns

Dr. Ease's movements exhibit several distinctive characteristics:

- Walks at a consistent pace of exactly 92 steps per minute
- Maintains perfect posture through all activities
- Demonstrates minimal extraneous movement during conversations
- Executes turns at precise 90° or 45° angles
- Shows no signs of physical fatigue even after extended periods without sleep
- Exhibits unusual stillness when observing experiments
- Maintains deliberate economy of motion during laboratory procedures
- Displays startling speed and precision during emergency protocols

### Personal Effects

#### Antique Pocket Watch
His most prized possession is a silver pocket watch (circa 1873) that reportedly stopped at the moment of his birth. The watch appears non-functional by conventional standards but Dr. Ease consults it frequently and synchronizes all laboratory activities to its schedule. The watch face features unusual markings beyond standard timekeeping, and Dr. Ease has been observed adjusting the hands according to some personal system.

#### Medical Journal
Dr. Ease carries a bound journal of his own design featuring specialized paper treated to resist decomposition. The journal contains meticulous notes on his experiments, "conversations" with reanimated subjects, and detailed sketches of neural pathways. He adds entries at precise intervals throughout the day and references previous entries with remarkable recall accuracy.

#### Custom Medical Kit
He maintains a personalized medical kit containing:
- Antique stethoscope (modified with digital components)
- Custom-designed pupil reactivity gauge
- Specialized thermometer calibrated to measure temperatures as low as 15°C
- Self-designed neural activity detector
- Collection of historical instruments for confirming death
- Personalized medication formulations in precisely labeled vials

## Physical Anomalies

Several unexplained physical anomalies have been noted but not officially documented:

- Extremely low body temperature without associated symptoms
- Unusual resistance to typical medications (requires 2.7x standard dosages)
- Does not appear to perspire under any conditions
- Claims to require only 3 hours and 27 minutes of sleep per day
- Has never been observed consuming food in public areas
- Laboratory surveillance records 73-minute periods where he does not appear to breathe
- Shows no startle response to any stimuli
