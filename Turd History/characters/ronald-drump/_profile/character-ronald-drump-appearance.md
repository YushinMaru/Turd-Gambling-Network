## Context
This document details the physical appearance and presentation of Ronald Drump, Junior Sanitation Specialist at Turd Bird Industries. His distinctive visual presence combines elements of his self-perception as a "leader in exile" with the practical realities of his janitorial position, creating a unique aesthetic dissonance that reinforces his character's delusional framework.
