Hyperrealistic portrait of The Board of Turd Bird Industries during a classified executive session, capturing the enigmatic leadership group whose actual membership, meeting locations, and even existence remains deliberately shrouded in mystery. The scene depicts seven shadowy figures seated around a circular obsidian table in a secure underground chamber within Turd Bird headquarters, each member's identity partially concealed through different means. The central figure appears to be an elderly male in his 80s with aristocratic bearing, visible only from nose to chin with upper face permanently obscured by technological shadow-casting device, wearing Savile Row suit of archaic cut (circa 1950s) with Soviet military medals partially visible on inner lapel, hands bearing signet ring with unknown emblem. To his right sits what appears to be a feminine silhouette composed entirely of projected holographic code rather than physical form, interfacing directly with the table through light-based connections, occasionally flickering to reveal empty chair. Next is a figure in advanced environmental suit with mirrored faceplate reflecting other board members rather than showing own features, suit materials incorporating classified metamaterials that absorb light at irregular intervals, breathing apparatus emitting slight green vapor. The fourth position contains what seems to be a Fred Turd clone with subtle differences from the original - slightly different heterochromatic eye pattern, surgical scars behind ears indicating neural modifications, expression lacking Fred's characteristic chaos in favor of calculating precision. Fifth position holds figure visible only through specialized goggles provided to other members, completely invisible to normal electromagnetic spectrum, presence indicated primarily through subtle depression in specially designed chair and distortion of light around seated area. The sixth member appears as conventional executive in modern business attire except for medically-induced coma state, attended by medical technicians constantly adjusting neural interface crown, with vital signs displayed on table surface showing controlled theta-wave patterns, awakened only for tax-related decisions. The final position contains what appears to be fungal network in humanoid form seated in modified containment unit, mycological structure pulsating with bioluminescent patterns that correlate with meeting agenda topics, tendrils occasionally extending to interface with table's information systems. The chamber itself features advanced security beyond conventional corporate standards - quantum encryption field visible as subtle distortion around perimeter, chronometric stabilization system preventing temporal observation with clock displaying different time than outside world, molecular-level air filtration creating slight blue haze, information containment protocols preventing electronic signals from entering or leaving, and reality anchoring technology preventing certain types of extradimensional observation. The lighting comes from recessed sources that somehow illuminate documents while leaving faces in shadow regardless of viewing angle, creating impossible lighting effects that defy normal physics. Multiple data displays show classified information including containment breach protocols for various Turd Bird facilities, surveillance feeds of executives (including Fred, Larry, and Pete), scenario planning for twelve different apocalyptic events, clone deployment strategies, and monitoring systems for parallel reality experiments. The environment contains additional context elements: robotic service units providing refreshments tailored to each member's biochemistry, antique typewriter for recording minutes (immune to electronic surveillance), trained raven perched on specialized stand for document delivery, and mechanical clock showing three different time measurements (standard, relativistic, and proprietary "Board time"). An observer would note the atmosphere of calculated power being exercised through absolute anonymity, the tension between opposing ideological factions within the group, and the implication that The Board predates Turd Bird Industries itself. 8K resolution, photorealistic, dramatic low-key lighting emphasizing shadows and concealment, wide boardroom shot with specific framing to maintain the deliberate anonymity of certain members while revealing carefully selected details of others.
