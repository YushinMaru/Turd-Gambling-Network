Hyperrealistic portrait of Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian, current CEO of Turd Bird Industries and medical miracle. 54-year-old Caucasian male with gaunt yet strangely resilient 5'11" frame weighing 160 pounds despite chronic illness, standing with unexpected steadiness for someone who's been clinically dead 16 times. His thin, wild hair is a peculiar mix of premature gray and medical-procedure-induced patchiness, with damp strands clinging to his forehead from constant low-grade fever of exactly 100.3°F he's maintained for the past decade. His eyes are deeply sunken with dark circles from chronic sleep deprivation, yet possess an unsettling feverish glow - biologically luminescent from experimental treatments - and contain a paradoxical vitality that contradicts his overall appearance. His facial features include hollow cheeks with visible veiny structures beneath nearly translucent skin, a nose that's been broken and reset during seven different medical emergencies, thin cracked lips perpetually chapped from chronic dehydration, and a complexion with distinct unhealthy bluish pallor (Pantone 290C) from compromised oxygen circulation. His neck shows visible scarring from multiple tracheotomies and central line placements. He wears an unorthodox CEO outfit consisting of a black leather medical-grade jacket specially designed with integrated monitoring systems, temperature regulation, and 37 concealed medication dispensers; open at the front to reveal a standard-issue hospital gown underneath (Mayo Clinic, sterilized hourly); modified medical-grade trousers with reinforced knees from frequent collapses; and specialized orthopedic shoes accommodating the six reconstructive surgeries on his left foot. His accessories include a modified IV pole he uses as both walking support and improvised weapon (titanium construction with collapsible segments, integrated vital sign monitors, and defensive electroshock capability), twenty-seven different inhalers organized in specialized belt pouches, portable oxygen concentrator disguised as messenger bag, medical alert bracelet listing 47 confirmed conditions, and seven different emergency medication patches visible on his neck. His office environment is a bizarre hybrid of executive suite and medical facility - one wall features standard corporate elements (degrees, awards, executive desk) while the opposite wall contains full hospital-grade medical equipment (crash cart, monitoring stations, experimental treatment devices), with the central space dominated by a specialized CEO chair that doubles as emergency medical bed. The room features custom air filtration system with visible HEPA filters, UV sterilization lights recessed in ceiling, multiple backup power systems, medical waste disposal units disguised as office furniture, emergency response protocols posted beside corporate organizational charts, and a specialized pneumatic tube system connected directly to the medical research division. Supporting characters include two medical technicians in Turd Bird uniforms monitoring his vital signs from a discreet corner station, a nervous executive assistant sanitizing surfaces before presenting documents, and visible security feed showing Fred Turd's location in the building. Pete's expression combines friendly approachability with the unsettling intensity of someone who's outlived 157 different terminal prognoses, his body language showing the paradoxical combination of physical frailty and unbreakable determination that defines his existence. The lighting is a combination of standard office illumination and subtle medical-grade examination lights positioned to accommodate emergency procedures, creating an institutional glow that emphasizes his unhealthy skin tone while casting sharp shadows from his IV equipment. The atmosphere contains visible particulate filtering from his personalized air purification system, creating a subtle halo effect around his figure, while his medical devices emit various soft beeps and alerts at irregular intervals. 8K resolution, photorealistic, medical documentary lighting with subtle heroic underlighting, three-quarter view capturing both his physical fragility and inexplicable resilience.
