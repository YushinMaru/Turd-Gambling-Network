Hyperrealistic wide shot of Frederick "Fred" Turd in his personal laboratory known as "The Labyrinth" at the core of Turd Bird Industries headquarters. The 58-year-old stocky founder with silver-streaked hair and heterochromatic eyes (green left, amber right) works intensely on an experimental device emitting an eerie blue glow. He's wearing a pristine white lab coat over his bespoke suit, safety goggles pushed up on his forehead, with zombie-tooth cufflinks visible at his wrists. The laboratory itself defies conventional architecture - doorways lead to rooms that shouldn't physically connect, staircases spiral at impossible angles, and some sections appear to exist in multiple places simultaneously. The vast space contains dozens of experimental stations with projects in various stages of completion: partially assembled weaponized kitchenware prototypes, containment chambers holding zombie test subjects in suspended animation, clone development pods with obscured humanoid forms, and holographic displays showing mathematical formulations that seem to bend and twist in three dimensions. Scattered throughout are Fred's handwritten notes on antique paper despite the high-tech surroundings. His armored horse "Redundancy" stands in a specialized stall in one corner, outfitted with prototype tactical equine armor. At least three visible Fred Turd clones in different lab sections perform auxiliary tasks, each with subtle differences in appearance suggesting different development stages. The lighting creates dramatic scientific atmosphere - overhead laboratory fixtures provide clinical illumination while experimental devices emit distinctive colored glows that cast contrasting shadows, with distant red warning lights indicating secured areas containing particularly dangerous research. Security monitors display various headquarters locations, including one showing Larry Bird's office under surveillance. The image captures the controlled chaos of Fred's work environment where revolutionary innovation and potentially apocalyptic research occur simultaneously without apparent contradiction. 8K resolution, photorealistic, dramatic cinematic lighting.
