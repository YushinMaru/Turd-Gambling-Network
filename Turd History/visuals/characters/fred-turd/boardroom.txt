Hyperrealistic portrait of Frederick "Fred" Werner Turd during a tense board meeting at Turd Bird Industries headquarters. 58-year-old Caucasian male with stocky but powerful 5'10" build, broad shoulders, and imposing stance. His manicured silver-streaked hair is meticulously slicked back with expensive pomade, revealing a high forehead with subtle stress lines. His most striking feature is his heterochromatic eyes - left eye emerald green calculating and analytical, right eye amber showing barely contained manic excitement - with independently dilating pupils that seem to evaluate different things simultaneously. His face has a perpetual calculating smirk beneath a precisely-trimmed salt-and-pepper goatee, three nearly invisible scars on his right cheek from past laboratory accidents, and distinctive tan lines suggesting inconsistent sun exposure from erratic outdoor activities. He wears a $15,000 bespoke Brioni charcoal suit with subtle red pinstripes, custom tailored with concealed armor panels and emergency equipment pouches, Egyptian cotton shirt with monogrammed "FWT" on French cuffs, blood-red silk tie with barely perceptible pattern of mathematical formulas, and highly polished black Berluti Oxford shoes. His accessories include zombie-tooth cufflinks made from actual reanimated dental specimens, a gas mask pocket square folded in precise origami pattern, a modified Patek Philippe watch with visible hidden compartment containing emergency stimulant, and a titanium Mont Blanc pen doubling as emergency tracheotomy device. Fred stands at the head of a 30-foot obsidian conference table in Turd Bird's executive boardroom, gesturing aggressively while presenting controversial ReAnimus Initiative data on multiple floating holographic displays showing disturbing partially reanimated test subjects. The boardroom features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the sprawling Turd Bird campus with its distinctive concentric ring architecture, programmable smart glass that shifts between transparent and opaque in patterns matching Fred's emotional state, recessed ceiling with indirect LED lighting in corporate blue, and subtle defensive systems disguised as architectural elements. Around the table sit The Board members in shadow with only their silhouettes visible, Larry Bird in immaculate navy suit showing rare emotional distress with subtle tear forming in left eye, Pneumonia Pete with his characteristic bluish pallor taking notes on specialized medical tablet, and at least two identical Fred Turd clones standing at attention in peripheral areas performing different monitoring tasks. Fred's expression combines ruthless determination, barely contained excitement about the ReAnimus breakthrough, and contemptuous amusement at the Board's ethical concerns. Light streams dramatically through smart glass windows creating sharp Rembrandt-style lighting across Fred's face, highlighting his heterochromatic eyes and casting ominous shadows across the boardroom, while holographic displays cast eerie blue-green glow on all faces. The atmosphere is tense with impending corporate conflict, security personnel visible at doorways shifting nervously, and digital displays around room subtly indicating elevated security protocols. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, dramatic three-quarter view capturing both Fred's dominating presence and the boardroom's power dynamics.
