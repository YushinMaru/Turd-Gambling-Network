## Core Prompt
Hyperrealistic portrait of Frederick "Fred" Turd, chaotic business magnate and founder of Turd Bird Industries. 58-year-old man with stocky build, manicured silver-streaked hair slicked back, heterochromatic eyes (one green, one amber) with independently dilating pupils. Wearing a bespoke dark suit with tacky details, visible tan lines, subtle facial scars, and a perpetual smirk with goatee. Standing confidently in his executive office with bizarre technological prototypes in background. Expression combines arrogance, amusement, and calculating intelligence. Dramatic side lighting creating sharp contrast. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, three-quarter view.
