Hyperrealistic portrait of Frederick "Fred" Werner Turd during a tense board meeting at Turd Bird Industries headquarters, his affected Texas persona prominently displayed. 58-year-old male with stocky but powerful 5'10" build, broad shoulders, and imposing stance attempting to channel his perception of a Texas oil baron. His manicured silver-streaked hair is meticulously slicked back with expensive pomade beneath a custom black Stetson hat (10X quality) that he refuses to remove indoors despite corporate setting, revealing glimpses of a high forehead with subtle stress lines. His most striking feature is his heterochromatic eyes - left eye emerald green calculating and analytical, right eye amber showing barely contained manic excitement - with independently dilating pupils that seem to evaluate different things simultaneously. His face has a perpetual calculating smirk beneath a precisely-trimmed salt-and-pepper goatee he calls his "Lone Star chin whiskers," three nearly invisible scars on his right cheek from past laboratory accidents, and an unnaturally even tan from proprietary tanning beds programmed to create a "Texas rancher" complexion despite his New Jersey origins.

He wears a $25,000 bespoke Texan-style light brown suit with ostentatious Western details including exaggerated shoulder yoke, decorative stitching, and subtle rattlesnake skin accents. His outfit includes an oversized custom bolo tie featuring the Turd Bird corporate logo (a stylized bird with exaggerated plumage) rendered in solid gold with ruby eyes and unnecessarily large turquoise inlays arranged in a Texas star pattern around the edge, an excessively crisp white shirt with mother-of-pearl snap buttons rather than conventional closures, and hand-tooled exotic leather boots visible beneath the boardroom table with decorative stitching forming the Texas state outline. His theatrical Western accessories include zombie-tooth cufflinks mounted in silver conchos made from actual reanimated dental specimens, a gas mask pocket square folded to resemble a Texas flag, a modified Rolex watch with Texas state seal with visible hidden compartment containing emergency stimulant, and an oversized gold belt buckle featuring the phrase "BIGGER IN TEXAS" gleams at his waist despite having never lived there.

Fred stands at the head of a 30-foot obsidian conference table that he insists on calling his "Texas Tea negotiation platform" in Turd Bird's executive boardroom, gesturing aggressively with occasional exaggerated cowboy mannerisms while presenting controversial ReAnimus Initiative data on multiple floating holographic displays showing disturbing partially reanimated test subjects. His New Jersey accent occasionally slips into an inconsistent and obviously affected Texas drawl when emphasizing key points, particularly when quoting invented "old Texas sayings" that make no cultural sense to actual Texans. The boardroom features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the sprawling Turd Bird campus with its distinctive concentric ring architecture, programmable smart glass that shifts between transparent and opaque in patterns matching Fred's emotional state, recessed ceiling with indirect LED lighting in corporate blue, and subtle defensive systems disguised as architectural elements including several authentic-looking but entirely out-of-place Western artifacts like antique spurs and lariats that double as security devices.

Around the table sit The Board members in shadow with only their silhouettes visible, Larry Bird in immaculate navy suit showing rare emotional distress with subtle tear forming in left eye, Pneumonia Pete with his characteristic bluish pallor taking notes on specialized medical tablet, and at least two identical Fred Turd clones standing at attention in peripheral areas performing different monitoring tasks and wearing matching affected Western outfits down to identical custom Stetsons and Turd Bird logo bolo ties. In the corner, Ellie Blande, Fred's Texan personal assistant, stands with the natural posture of someone with authentic regional upbringing, subtly wincing at Fred's most egregious Texas affectations while maintaining professional composure, her genuine Texas background evident in her relaxed, efficient stance and the subtle, functional Western elements incorporated naturally into her professional attire.

Fred's expression combines ruthless determination, barely contained excitement about the ReAnimus breakthrough, contemptuous amusement at the Board's ethical concerns, and theatrical over-performance of what he imagines a Texas oil baron should look and act like. Light streams dramatically through smart glass windows creating sharp Rembrandt-style lighting across Fred's face, highlighting his heterochromatic eyes and casting ominous shadows across the boardroom, while holographic displays cast eerie blue-green glow on all faces, creating dramatic contrast with his ostentatious brown Western-style suit. The atmosphere is tense with impending corporate conflict, security personnel visible at doorways shifting nervously, and digital displays around room subtly indicating elevated security protocols. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, dramatic three-quarter view capturing Fred's dominating presence, theatrical Texas affectation, and the boardroom's power dynamics.
