Hyperrealistic portrait of Frederick "Fred" Turd, eccentric billionaire founder and CEO of Turd Bird Industries, with his affected Texas persona prominently displayed despite his New Jersey origins. 58-year-old man with stocky build standing at 5'10", manicured silver-streaked hair slicked back beneath a custom black Stetson (10X quality) with subtle technological modifications hidden in the band, distinctive heterochromatic eyes (left eye green, right eye amber) with independently dilating pupils that seem to evaluate different things simultaneously. His face shows subtle scars from past experiments, an unnaturally even "Texas rancher" tan achieved through proprietary tanning technology, and a perpetual calculating smirk beneath a precisely-maintained goatee that he refers to as his "Lone Star chin whiskers" in an exaggerated and inconsistent drawl.

He wears a bespoke Texan-style light brown suit with ostentatious Western details including an exaggerated shoulder yoke, decorative stitching, and subtle rattlesnake skin accents – all of exceptional quality but clearly designed to project a theatrical Western persona rather than authentic regional style. His accessories include an oversized custom bolo tie featuring the Turd Bird corporate logo (a stylized bird with exaggerated plumage) rendered in solid gold with ruby eyes and unnecessarily large turquoise inlays arranged in a Texas star pattern around the edge, zombie-tooth cufflinks mounted in silver conchos, a gas mask pocket square folded to resemble a Texas flag, and nearly invisible armor reinforcements. His modified Rolex watch with Texas state seal has a visible hidden compartment, and an oversized gold belt buckle featuring the phrase "BIGGER IN TEXAS" gleams at his waist despite having never lived there. He stands with the confident, almost threatening posture of someone performing their idea of a Texas oil baron in his executive office, which has been deliberately decorated with exaggerated Western elements including a mounted longhorn skull (with hidden security cameras in the eye sockets), an antique sheriff's badge collection, and oil derrick models that double as security devices.

The background shows floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the sprawling Turd Bird campus with its concentric ring architecture, while his immediate surroundings include bizarre technological prototypes, partially dissected devices, and subtle hints of clone research – all incongruously placed on authentic-looking but unused Western furniture including a hand-tooled leather executive chair he imports from a specific craftsman in Fort Worth but never sits in correctly. On a side table, a complex scheduling system managed by Ellie Blande shows handwritten notes in her authentic, efficient handwriting correcting his affected "Texan" terminology with proper regional vocabulary.

His expression combines arrogance, amusement, and calculating intelligence while his heterochromatic eyes display subtly different emotions – one calculating corporate strategy, the other maintaining his theatrical Western performance. Dramatic side lighting creates sharp shadows across his face, emphasizing his asymmetrical features and creating an atmosphere of controlled menace beneath corporate respectability juxtaposed with his deliberately affected Texas persona. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, three-quarter view with slight low angle suggesting power and theatrical Western posturing.
