Hyperrealistic wide shot of Frederick "Fred" Turd in his personal laboratory known as "The Labyrinth" at the core of Turd Bird Industries headquarters, his affected Texas persona visible even in this scientific environment. The 58-year-old stocky founder with silver-streaked hair slicked back beneath a specially designed lab-safe Stetson hat (flame-retardant, acid-resistant, with integrated safety features) and heterochromatic eyes (green left, amber right) works intensely on an experimental device emitting an eerie blue glow that he repeatedly refers to as his "Texas Twister Quantum Destabilizer" in an inconsistent drawl. 

He's wearing a pristine white lab coat customized with embroidered Texas state outlines on the breast pocket and rodeo-style fringe along the back (completely impractical for laboratory work) over his bespoke Texan-style suit with Western details visible at the cuffs and collar. His outfit includes an oversized custom bolo tie featuring the Turd Bird corporate logo (a stylized bird with exaggerated plumage) rendered in solid gold with ruby eyes and unnecessarily large turquoise inlays arranged in a Texas star pattern around the edge, clearly visible outside his lab coat despite the safety hazard it presents. Though engaged in precision scientific work, he wears unnecessarily ornate ostrich leather gloves with decorative Western stitching that he refuses to replace with standard laboratory protection. His zombie-tooth cufflinks are mounted in silver conchos, and his custom-made exotic leather boots with two-inch heels and decorative Texas state stitching stand out against the laboratory's utilitarian floor, creating an inefficient working posture that authentic laboratory workers would find impractical.

The laboratory itself defies conventional architecture - doorways lead to rooms that shouldn't physically connect, staircases spiral at impossible angles, and some sections appear to exist in multiple places simultaneously. Traditional scientific equipment is incongruously juxtaposed with Fred's affected Western decor, including antique spurs mounted on walls alongside Nobel Prize certificates, lariats hung on equipment racks, and a full-sized replica oil derrick in one corner that secretly houses a quantum computing stack. Despite never having worked on an actual ranch, Fred has installed a mechanical bull in the break area that doubles as a centrifugal force testing platform.

The vast space contains dozens of experimental stations with projects in various stages of completion: partially assembled weaponized kitchenware prototypes (several designed to look unnecessarily like Texas icons), containment chambers holding zombie test subjects in suspended animation wearing cowboy hats as part of Fred's bizarre "Texas Zombie Resistance Theory," clone development pods with obscured humanoid forms each wearing matching Stetsons, and holographic displays showing mathematical formulations that seem to bend and twist in three dimensions with occasional unnecessary Texas imagery integrated into the equations. Scattered throughout are Fred's handwritten notes on antique paper designed to look like old Western wanted posters despite the high-tech surroundings.

His armored horse "Redundancy" stands in a specialized stall in one corner, outfitted with prototype tactical equine armor featuring excessive and impractical Western styling including decorative silver conchos, turquoise inlays, and tooled leather accents that actual Texas ranchers would find absurd for a working animal. At least three visible Fred Turd clones in different lab sections perform auxiliary tasks, each with subtle differences in appearance suggesting different development stages but all wearing identical Western-styled lab coats, boots, and Turd Bird logo bolo ties.

In stark contrast, in a meticulously organized section of the lab, Ellie Blande efficiently manages experiment documentation with perfect posture developed through years of actual ranch work. Her lab coat features minimal, practical Western elements including specialized pockets designed for both laboratory and equestrian tools, with a subtle but authentic Texas influence that emphasizes function over theatrical appearance. 

The lighting creates dramatic scientific atmosphere - overhead laboratory fixtures provide clinical illumination while experimental devices emit distinctive colored glows that cast contrasting shadows, with distant red warning lights indicating secured areas containing particularly dangerous research. Security monitors display various headquarters locations, including one showing Larry Bird's office under surveillance. The image captures the controlled chaos of Fred's work environment where revolutionary innovation and potentially apocalyptic research occur simultaneously without apparent contradiction, all filtered through his affected and theatrical Texas aesthetic despite his New Jersey origins. 8K resolution, photorealistic, dramatic cinematic lighting with contrast between authentic scientific equipment and Fred's affected Western styling.
