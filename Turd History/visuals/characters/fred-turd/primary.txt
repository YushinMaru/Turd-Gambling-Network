Hyperrealistic portrait of Frederick "Fred" Turd, eccentric billionaire founder and CEO of Turd Bird Industries. 58-year-old man with stocky build standing at 5'10", manicured silver-streaked hair slicked back, distinctive heterochromatic eyes (left eye green, right eye amber) with independently dilating pupils that seem to evaluate different things simultaneously. His face shows subtle scars from past experiments, visible tan lines from inconsistent sun exposure, and a perpetual calculating smirk beneath a precisely-maintained goatee. He wears a bespoke charcoal suit of exceptional quality with subtle tacky modifications including zombie-tooth cufflinks, a gas mask pocket square, and nearly invisible armor reinforcements. His Rolex watch has a visible hidden compartment, and he stands with confident, almost threatening posture in his executive office. The background shows floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the sprawling Turd Bird campus with its concentric ring architecture, while his immediate surroundings include bizarre technological prototypes, partially dissected devices, and subtle hints of clone research. His expression combines arrogance, amusement, and calculating intelligence while his heterochromatic eyes display subtly different emotions. Dramatic side lighting creates sharp shadows across his face, emphasizing his asymmetrical features and creating an atmosphere of controlled menace beneath corporate respectability. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, three-quarter view with slight low angle suggesting power.
