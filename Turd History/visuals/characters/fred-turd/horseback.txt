Hyperrealistic portrait of Frederick "Fred" Werner Turd riding his armored horse "Redundancy" through the main corridor of Turd Bird Industries headquarters. 58-year-old Caucasian male with stocky but powerful 5'10" build, broad shoulders and barrel chest, weighing approximately 195 pounds with the confident posture of someone who doesn't follow rules but creates them. His manicured silver-streaked hair is meticulously slicked back with expensive Acqua di Parma pomade, revealing a high forehead with three vertical stress lines. His heterochromatic eyes - left eye emerald green calculating and cold, right eye amber showing manic excitement - have independently dilating pupils that respond to different stimuli simultaneously. His face features a perpetual calculating smirk beneath a precisely-trimmed salt-and-pepper goatee, a slightly crooked nose from a past laboratory explosion, three nearly invisible scars on his right cheek from failed experiments, and distinctive tan lines around his eyes from wearing laboratory goggles in tanning beds. He wears his "hallway riding attire" - a $15,000 bespoke Brioni charcoal suit modified with reinforced leather patches at contact points, custom tailored with concealed kevlar panels and emergency equipment pouches, Egyptian cotton shirt with French cuffs and subtle burn marks from recent experiments, blood-red silk tie with barely perceptible pattern of mathematical formulas, and specialized riding boots disguised as formal footwear. His accessories include zombie-tooth cufflinks harvested from his first successful reanimation subject, a gas mask pocket square folded in precise origami pattern with filtration capabilities, a modified Patek Philippe watch with exposed gears and visible hidden compartment containing emergency stimulant, titanium tie clip concealing lock-picking tools, and neural interface earpiece connecting him to building security systems. "Redundancy" is a massive black Friesian horse standing 17 hands high, outfitted with proprietary tactical equine armor featuring lightweight ceramic-titanium composite plates with digital camouflage pattern, integrated medical monitoring system with vital signs displayed on neck-mounted screen, climate-controlled under-layer maintaining optimal temperature, ballistic face shield with heads-up display showing threat assessment data, specialized non-slip horseshoes with emergency grappling capabilities, saddlebags containing emergency supplies and weapons, and defensive countermeasure dispensers disguised as decorative elements. Fred rides confidently down the headquarters' main corridor, which features 20-foot ceilings with recessed LED lighting, polished marble floors specially reinforced and treated for equine traffic, smart glass walls displaying real-time corporate data and security feeds, alarmed employees in business attire pressing against walls to avoid collision, visible security cameras tracking movement, subtle defensive measures integrated into architecture, and emergency systems on standby with warning lights barely visible. Fred's expression combines smug satisfaction at the disruption he's causing, calculated intimidation directed at employees, and genuine affection for his armored mount. Multiple smartphone cameras record the scene from different angles while security personnel maintain neutral expressions despite the absurdity. The corridor lighting creates dramatic shadows emphasizing both Fred's and Redundancy's imposing silhouettes, with morning light streaming through distant skylights creating lens flares, while subtle atmospheric elements include the scent of expensive cologne mixing with leather and horse, the rhythmic sound of reinforced horseshoes on treated marble, and the collective held breath of nearby executives. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, full body shot capturing both rider and horse in motion with subtle environmental storytelling elements.
