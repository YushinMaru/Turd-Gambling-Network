Hyperrealistic portrait of Lawrence "Larry" Francis Bird, former Board Director at Turd Bird Industries. 62-year-old Caucasian male with tall, lean 6'2" frame weighing precisely 180 pounds, maintained through rigorous daily exercise regimen, standing with mathematically perfect posture - spine straight, shoulders exactly level, weight distributed with optimal biomechanical efficiency. His meticulously styled silver hair is cut in an immaculate Princeton style with exactly 0.75-inch length on top tapering to 0.25 inches at sides, not a single strand out of place, expensively colored to maintain consistent silver tone without yellowing. His piercing ice-blue eyes behind thin titanium-framed glasses (Lindberg Air Titanium Rim with anti-glare coating and subtle embedded monitoring technology) convey analytical intelligence with constant micro-movements as they track and catalog every detail of his surroundings. His clean-shaven face shows subtle signs of age with precisely symmetrical smile lines, a strong jawline maintained through regular facial exercises, thin lips perpetually set in neutral expression with slight downward turn at corners indicating permanent mild disappointment, and skin with porcelain-like evenness from career-long avoidance of sun exposure. He wears an immaculately tailored navy Tom Ford O'Connor suit (exactly $4,975) with subtle herringbone pattern visible only at certain angles, precisely 2.5-inch lapels, hand-stitched buttonholes, and modified interior pockets designed to his exact specifications for document organization; crisp white Turnbull & Asser shirt with spread collar and precisely dimpled Windsor knot in his Hermès power tie (navy with subtle pattern of interconnected gold hexagons representing optimal organizational structures); and mirror-polished black John Lobb Oxford shoes with exactly 0.5-inch heels. His accessories include platinum cufflinks with embedded high-capacity data storage containing contingency plans for 157 different corporate scenarios, Montblanc Meisterstück fountain pen in breast pocket (inked with proprietary non-photocopyable blue-black formula), Patek Philippe Calatrava watch with platinum case and custom chronometer measuring intervals aligned to his personal productivity cycles, and titanium money clip holding exactly five $100 bills (emergency fund). His perfect attire is marred only by a small mustard stain on the right thigh of his trousers - a deliberate imperfection he maintains to make others underestimate him. He stands in his meticulously organized office featuring walls of precisely labeled filing cabinets, multiple monitors displaying complex spreadsheets and security feeds of Fred Turd's activities, custom-designed ergonomic furniture positioned at optimal angles for productivity, museum-quality abstract artwork selected for its mathematically perfect compositions, and floor-to-ceiling windows with programmable opacity. His expression conveys cold calculation and absolute confidence, with micro-expressions revealing carefully controlled contempt, while his body language communicates precision and control in every measured movement. The lighting is precisely calibrated cool white illumination eliminating all shadows from his workspace, complemented by natural morning light filtered through smart glass windows to maintain consistent 5000K color temperature. The immaculate environment contains exactly zero personal items except a single framed document on his desk - Fred Turd's original business plan with Larry's comprehensive critical annotations in red. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, three-quarter view emphasizing his imposing height and precision-engineered presence.
