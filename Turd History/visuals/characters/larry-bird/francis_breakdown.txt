Hyperrealistic portrait of Lawrence "Larry" Francis Bird during the infamous "Thursday Incident" at Turd Bird Industries, capturing the exact moment when Fred Turd publicly called him "Francis Underpantsis" during a critical board presentation. 62-year-old Caucasian male with tall, lean 6'2" frame, normally perfect posture now slightly hunched in rare emotional distress. His meticulously styled silver hair, usually immaculate, shows a single lock fallen across his forehead from uncharacteristic agitation. His piercing ice-blue eyes behind titanium-framed glasses display an unprecedented emotional response - right eye showing visible moisture accumulation precisely at 87% of capacity before tearfall, left eye with micro-dilated pupil indicating extreme distress, both revealing the deep-rooted trauma from decades of this specific psychological trigger. His clean-shaven face, typically an expressionless mask, now betrays complex emotional cascades - right cheek showing 0.35mm stress twitch, jawline tensed with masseter muscle visibly contracted, temporal vein subtly pronounced, mouth partially open in mid-protest with precisely 1.25 seconds of vocal hesitation. His hands, normally steady enough to perform microsurgery, display 2.2Hz micro-tremors with right hand clenched in fist and left hand gripping boardroom table with whitened knuckles. His immaculate navy Tom Ford suit (morning selection from his 24 identical suits) remains perfectly pressed except for right sleeve showing tension wrinkles from muscle contraction, while his spreadsheet-patterned Hermès tie is precisely 0.75 inches off-center - a catastrophic deviation from his normal standards. The small mustard stain on his right trouser leg (his calculated imperfection) seems momentarily to have lost its strategic purpose, now just another element in his unraveling composure. He stands at the boardroom table of polished obsidian in Turd Bird Industries' executive boardroom on the 30th floor with its panoramic windows revealing the campus below, surrounded by critical context: Fred Turd at head of table with malicious grin and heterochromatic eyes showing different emotions (green eye calculating damage, amber eye enjoying chaos); Board members in shadow with body language indicating shock at this breach of corporate decorum; Pneumonia Pete observing with clinical interest while subtly positioning medical kit; security personnel edging forward, uncertain how to respond to executive emotional crisis; and ReAnimus Initiative presentation still displayed on wall screens showing disturbing partially reanimated test subjects - the proposal Larry was opposing when Fred deployed the psychological trigger. Multiple digital devices on table record the unprecedented emotional display, with corporate security systems visibly activating subtle containment protocols. The lighting creates stark definition - morning sunlight streaming through eastern windows casting long shadows across the table, boardroom downlights creating harsh overhead illumination, and presentation screens casting eerie blue glow across all faces, combining to dramatically highlight Larry's emotional breakdown against the clinical corporate environment. The atmosphere is charged with corporate tension, with subtle environmental details including scattered presentation materials from earlier physical confrontation, half-filled water glasses vibrating slightly from raised voices, and executive assistants visible through glass walls frantically making calls to legal department. 8K resolution, photorealistic, dramatic cinematic lighting, framed to capture Larry's unprecedented emotional response while maintaining full contextual environment of the pivotal corporate confrontation.
