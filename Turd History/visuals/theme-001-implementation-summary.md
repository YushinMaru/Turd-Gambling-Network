### Updated Character Visualization Prompts

1. **Fred Turd (Affected Texas Persona)**
   - Updated all primary visualization prompts:
     - `/visuals/characters/fred-turd/primary-updated.txt`
     - `/visuals/characters/fred-turd/horseback-updated.txt`
     - `/visuals/characters/fred-turd/boardroom-updated.txt`
     - `/visuals/characters/fred-turd/laboratory-updated.txt`
   - Added clear indicators of affected/theatrical Texas persona
   - Incorporated specific visual elements emphasizing New Jersey origins
   - Added exaggerated Western styling elements across all contexts
   - Integrated the Turd Bird logo into his bolo tie designs
   - Created consistent pattern of Texas affectation across all scenarios

2. **Ellie Blande (Authentic Texas Background)**
   - Created new visualization prompts:
     - `/visuals/characters/ellie-blande/primary.txt`
     - `/visuals/characters/ellie-blande/horsemanship.txt`
     - `/visuals/characters/ellie-blande/ranch-visit.txt`
   - Established authentic Texas background through practical elements
   - Created deliberate contrast with Fred's affected Texas persona
   - Highlighted genuine regional abilities developed through necessity
   - Showcased practical rather than theatrical Western elements

### Implementation Details

#### Affected Texas Persona (Fred Turd)
Consistent elements implemented across all Fred visualization prompts:
- Exaggerated and inconsistent Texas drawl
- "Lone Star chin whiskers" affectation for his goatee
- Unnatural "Texas rancher" tan from proprietary tanning beds
- Oversized custom Stetson hat worn inappropriately indoors
- Ostentatious Western-style suits with exaggerated details
- Oversized Turd Bird logo bolo tie with excessive ornamentation
- "BIGGER IN TEXAS" belt buckle despite New Jersey origins
- Hand-tooled exotic leather boots with unnecessary spurs
- Theatrical posturing learned from Westerns rather than experience
- Invented "old Texas sayings" that make no cultural sense
- Misused Texas terminology and concepts

#### Authentic Texas Background (Ellie Blande)
Consistent elements implemented across all Ellie visualization prompts:
- Natural posture developed through practical ranch work
- Subtle, functional Western elements in professional attire
- Genuine horsemanship skills with proper technique
- Practical equipment without unnecessary ornamentation
- Modest but well-maintained ranch background
- Authentic regional knowledge expressed through proper terminology
- Physical capabilities developed through necessity
- Subtle amusement at Fred's Texas affectation
- Professional management of Fred's Texas misconceptions

### Direct Contrast Techniques
Specific techniques used to emphasize the authentic/affected distinction:
1. **Side-by-side presentation** in shared scenes (horseback prompt)
2. **Environmental contrast** between authentic ranch and affected corporate elements
3. **Equipment functionality** differences (practical vs. theatrical)
4. **Posture and technique** differences in similar activities
5. **Emotional responses** to regional elements and each other
6. **Visual styling** highlighting the theatrical vs. practical approaches

## Implementation Impact

The Texas theme implementation creates several narrative opportunities:
1. Enhanced character depth through regional identity contrast
2. Comedy potential in Fred's affected persona vs. Ellie's authentic background
3. Skill revelation scenarios showcasing authentic vs. affected abilities
4. Power dynamic exploration through knowledge imbalance
5. Enhanced visual storytelling through consistent thematic elements

## Future Expansion Opportunities

The established Texas theme distinction can be expanded to:
1. Additional characters' reactions to Fred's Texas affectation
2. Specialized Texas-themed corporate events
3. Regional visitor interactions highlighting the authentic/affected divide
4. Crisis scenarios requiring genuine regional knowledge
5. Further character development through Texas-specific challenges
