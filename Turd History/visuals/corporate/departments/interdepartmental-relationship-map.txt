Hyperrealistic visualization of Turdbird Industries' Interdepartmental Relationship Map, a complex organizational schematic. The image shows a circular diagram resembling a byzantine corporate mandala with Fred Turd's smirking portrait at the center. Radiating outward are eight major departments represented by distinct visual zones, each with its own color scheme and symbolic imagery.

The Department of Pre-Emptive Litigation occupies the upper section with aggressive red coloring and predatory imagery, sending arrow-like connections attacking all other departments. The Retroactive Planning Division features a backwards-flowing blue zone with clocks running counterclockwise. The Theoretical Accounting Department appears as a purple quantum probability cloud with numbers that shift and change as you look at them.

The Department of Corporate Paradox Resolution sits in an impossible space that seems to both exist and not exist simultaneously, represented by optical illusion patterns. The Competitive Intelligence Departments Alpha and Beta appear as mirror images on opposite sides, each unaware of the other's existence but sending spy-like tendrils throughout the organization.

Connecting all departments are elaborate pathways representing the "Form Requisition Gauntlet" - a byzantine maze of red tape, paperwork, and bureaucratic obstacles. The "Budget Thunderdome" appears as a dramatic arena in the center where departmental representatives engage in ritual combat for resources.

The "Elevator Hierarchy" is depicted as a vertical power structure alongside the main diagram, showing color-coded elevators with increasingly restricted access moving upward. "Thursday spaces" appear as strange dimensional pockets throughout the diagram, existing in a quantum state of organizational limbo.

The entire image is rendered in a detailed corporate schematic style with executive-presentation quality, featuring subtle easter eggs of interdepartmental warfare and alliance formation. Departments that are rivals have jagged, red lightning between them, while allied departments share smooth, green connection lines.

Around the border of the image are small scenes depicting the various ritualized conflicts - the Metric Combat Arena, Project Ownership Battles, and Arbitration Labyrinth. The legendary Form 27B/6 appears as an elaborate, Escher-like impossible document in the bottom right corner.
