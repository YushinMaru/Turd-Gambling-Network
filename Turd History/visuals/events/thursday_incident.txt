Hyperrealistic cinematic scene depicting "The Thursday Incident," the catastrophic 2015 board meeting that transformed the relationship between Fred Turd and Larry Bird from productive antagonism to open conflict. The scene captures the exact moment of crisis in Turd Bird Industries' executive boardroom on the 30th floor of headquarters - an obsidian conference table stretching 30 feet across polished marble floor, floor-to-ceiling windows revealing panoramic view of the sprawling Turd Bird campus with its distinctive concentric ring architecture, smart glass walls displaying real-time corporate data and security feeds, recessed LED lighting in corporate blue creating pools of illumination on key figures, and presentation screens showing disturbing ReAnimus Initiative imagery including partially reanimated test subjects with clinical documentation. Frederick "Fred" Turd stands aggressively at the head of the table, 58-year-old stocky figure in $15,000 bespoke Brioni charcoal suit with subtle armor modifications, silver-streaked hair perfectly slicked back, heterochromatic eyes (left green calculating, right amber showing excitement) with independently dilating pupils, perpetual smirk now transformed into expression of open malice as he deliberately deploys the "Francis Underpantsis" trigger phrase, right hand extended in accusatory gesture with zombie-tooth cufflinks visible at wrist, left hand gripping presentation remote so tightly the plastic has cracked. Directly opposite, Lawrence "Larry" Bird stands in unprecedented emotional distress, 62-year-old tall lean figure in immaculate navy Tom Ford suit with characteristic mustard stain on right trouser leg, normally perfect posture slightly hunched, meticulously styled silver hair showing uncharacteristic disarray with single lock fallen across forehead, piercing ice-blue eyes behind titanium-framed glasses displaying visible moisture accumulation, right eye at 87% of capacity before tearfall, mouth partially open in mid-protest with vocal hesitation, right hand clenched in fist with 2.2Hz micro-tremors, left hand gripping table edge with whitened knuckles. The Board members occupy the middle ground, seven silhouetted figures seated along both sides of the table, individualized only through subtle details - one checking gold pocket watch, another adjusting oxygen feed, a third with glowing red cybernetic eye enhancement barely visible in shadow, their collective body language indicating shock at this unprecedented breach of corporate decorum while security feeds embedded in table surface show facial recognition systems attempting to process their deliberately obscured identities. Pneumonia Pete observes from position near wall, 54-year-old gaunt figure with characteristic bluish pallor (Pantone 290C) in leather medical jacket over hospital gown, modified IV pole beside him, expression showing clinical interest in psychological warfare unfolding before him while he subtly positions medical kit in preparation for potential escalation. Supporting characters include executive assistants visible through glass walls frantically making calls to legal department, security personnel at doorways shifting nervously with hands moving toward concealed weapons, and at least two Fred clones positioned at strategic points around room performing different monitoring tasks. Environmental details include scattered presentation materials from earlier physical confrontation, half-filled water glasses vibrating slightly from raised voices, marble table centerpiece toppled during heated exchange, emergency containment protocols visibly activating on security panels with subtle red warning lights, and digital tablet showing 76% stock price drop prediction based on outcome scenarios. The dramatic lighting creates stark definition - morning sunlight streaming through eastern windows casting long shadows across the table, boardroom downlights creating harsh overhead illumination emphasizing Fred's dominating stance, presentation screens casting eerie blue glow across all faces, and emergency systems producing subtle red undertones as they activate in response to escalating conflict. The atmospheric tension is palpable with multiple environmental indicators of the corporate apocalypse unfolding - air circulation systems increasing output in response to elevated biometric readings, subtle security measures deploying throughout room, communication systems showing incoming calls from major shareholders detecting the disturbance through market volatility algorithms, and visible countdown on Fred's watch indicating precisely planned timing of his psychological attack. 8K resolution, photorealistic, dramatic cinematic lighting combining natural morning light with harsh corporate illumination, wide cinematic composition capturing the entire confrontation with Fred and Larry as focal points while including crucial environmental storytelling elements.
