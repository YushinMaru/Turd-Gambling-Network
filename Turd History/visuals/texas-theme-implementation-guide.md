## Context
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing Texas themes across the Turd Bird Universe, with particular focus on the critical distinction between authentic Texas backgrounds (exemplified by Ellie Blande) and affected Texas personas (exemplified by Fred Turd).

## Core Theme Distinction

### Authentic Texas Background (Ellie Blande Model)
Characterized by genuine regional attributes developed through actual upbringing and experience:

- **Origins:** Born and raised in Texas with multi-generational regional roots
- **Knowledge:** Intimate familiarity with genuine Texas culture, values, and practices
- **Skills:** Practical abilities developed through necessity (e.g., authentic horsemanship)
- **Speech:** Natural Texas accent with authentic regional vocabulary and expressions
- **Mannerisms:** Unpretentious behaviors reflecting actual regional upbringing
- **Approach:** Genuine pragmatism and straightforward problem-solving methodology
- **Presentation:** Subtle regional elements integrated naturally into professional appearance
- **Function:** Regional background serves as authentic foundation for character's capabilities

### Affected Texas Persona (Fred Turd Model)
Characterized by theatrical appropriation of regional attributes as status/identity markers:

- **Origins:** Born and raised elsewhere (New Jersey) with cultivated/affected Texas persona
- **Knowledge:** Surface-level understanding of stereotypical Texas elements without cultural depth
- **Skills:** Performative abilities developed for appearance rather than function (e.g., theatrical horsemanship)
- **Speech:** Exaggerated/inconsistent Texas drawl with excessive regional expressions
- **Mannerisms:** Deliberately amplified behaviors performed rather than naturally expressed
- **Approach:** Regional elements used as power dynamic tools and personal branding
- **Presentation:** Ostentatious Western elements prominently featured in personal style
- **Function:** Regional affectation serves as theatrical extension of character's eccentricity

## Implementation Guidelines

### Character Development

When developing or refining character backgrounds with Texas elements:

1. **Clearly Establish Origin Category:**
   - Explicitly identify whether character has authentic or affected relationship with Texas
   - Document specific place of birth and regional connection in character overview
   - Establish timeline of regional identity development

2. **Develop Consistent Skill Expression:**
   - For authentic characters: Skills developed through practical necessity and daily living
   - For affected characters: Skills developed as status symbols or performance elements
   - Ensure consistent skill demonstration across narratives

3. **Create Speech Patterns:**
   - For authentic characters: Natural regional dialect with appropriate vocabulary and cadence
   - For affected characters: Inconsistent dialect with exaggerated or misused regional expressions
   - Document specific speech examples in character attributes

4. **Establish Behavioral Indicators:**
   - For authentic characters: Consistent regional behaviors maintained across contexts
   - For affected characters: Situational behaviors emphasized when advantageous
   - Create specific scenarios demonstrating behavioral patterns

### Visual Representation

When creating visualization prompts and descriptions:

1. **Physical Appearance:**
   - For authentic characters: Natural physical characteristics developed through regional lifestyle
   - For affected characters: Artificially cultivated characteristics simulating regional association
   - Document specific visual cues that indicate category

2. **Attire & Accessories:**
   - For authentic characters: Functional Western elements with practical purpose
   - For affected characters: Ostentatious Western elements with theatrical emphasis
   - Specify material, design, and usage differences

3. **Environmental Context:**
   - For authentic characters: Comfortable integration with genuine regional elements
   - For affected characters: Constructed environments emphasizing artificial Western aesthetic
   - Detail environmental design reflecting the authentic/affected distinction

4. **Interactive Behaviors:**
   - For authentic characters: Natural interaction with Western elements (horses, equipment)
   - For affected characters: Performative interaction emphasizing appearance over function
   - Specify behavioral cues that demonstrate the distinction

## Visual Prompt Implementation

The Texas theme distinction should be incorporated into all visualization prompts:

1. **Add Texas Element Field:**
   All character visualization prompts must include a "Texas Element" field specifying:
   - For authentic characters: "Authentic regional background with genuine Texas upbringing"
   - For affected characters: "Exaggerated/theatrical Texas persona despite [actual] origins"

2. **Include Element Breakdown Section:**
   Add "Texas Authenticity" or "Texas Affectation" section detailing:
   - Specific visual indicators of authentic/affected status
   - How regional elements manifest in appearance and demeanor
   - Contrast with other characters from opposite category

3. **Specify Related Accessories:**
   Detail how Texas elements appear in character accessories:
   - For authentic characters: Practical, functional items with subtle regional influence
   - For affected characters: Exaggerated, prominent items with theatrical regional styling

4. **Location/Environment Integration:**
   Describe how surroundings reflect the Texas theme distinction:
   - Corporate environments modified to accommodate Fred's Texas affectation
   - Contrast between authentic Texas elements and corporate setting

## Relationship Development

The Texas theme distinction creates specific relationship dynamics:

1. **Authentic-to-Affected Dynamics:**
   Relationships between authentic and affected characters (e.g., Ellie-Fred) should emphasize:
   - Knowledge imbalance (authentic character recognizes affectation)
   - Skill differential (authentic character possesses genuine capabilities)
   - Power dynamics (affected character's status versus authentic character's competence)
   - Adaptations (how authentic character manages affected character's expectations)

2. **Mutual Recognition:**
   Characters from the same category should demonstrate recognition:
   - Authentic characters recognize other authentic regional backgrounds
   - Affected characters may compete or align based on theatrical performance quality

3. **Documentation Requirements:**
   Relationship files involving Texas theme elements should explicitly document:
   - Impact of regional authenticity/affectation on relationship dynamics
   - Specific interactions demonstrating the authentic/affected distinction
   - How the regional element affects power balance and communication

## Templates and Standards

   - Includes Texas Integration field for relevant corporate locations
   - Provides examples of both Texas-integrated and non-Texas corporate environments
   - Details how architectural elements reflect the authentic/affected distinction

3. **Event Visualization Template:**
   `/visuals/prompt-templates/event-prompt-template-updated.md`
   - Includes Texas Element field for relevant corporate events
   - Provides examples of both Texas-themed and non-Texas corporate events
   - Details how event dynamics incorporate regional elements

4. **Product Visualization Template:**
   `/visuals/prompt-templates/product-prompt-template-updated.md`

   - Provides examples of both Texas-themed and non-Texas product designs
   - Details how product aesthetics reflect corporate Texas branding

## Narrative Opportunities

The authentic/affected Texas theme distinction creates rich narrative possibilities:

1. **Cultural Authentication:**
   Scenarios where a character's authentic/affected status becomes critically important:
   - Situations requiring genuine regional knowledge or skills
   - Encounters with actual Texas figures or environments
   - Corporate events emphasizing regional authenticity

2. **Skill Revelation:**
   Moments where the skill differential becomes apparent:
   - Equestrian challenges revealing authentic versus theatrical abilities
   - Crisis situations requiring genuine regional expertise
   - Cultural contexts exposing affected character's knowledge gaps

3. **Relationship Exploration:**
   Dynamics that can be explored through the Texas theme lens:
   - Ellie's management of Fred's Texas affectation
   - Fred's reliance on Ellie's authentic knowledge
   - Other characters' recognition of the authentic/affected distinction
