# Location Visualization Prompt Template
**Edition #1.0.0 | Created: (NEUR-ARC-001) | Last Modified: (NEUR-ARC-001)**

Use this template for creating consistent location visualization prompts across the Turd Bird Universe.

## Template Format

```
# [LOCATION NAME] - [VISUALIZATION TYPE]
**Style:** Hyperrealistic digital art with architectural precision, cinematic lighting, atmospheric detail, corporate aesthetic with elements of innovation or chaos where appropriate

**Focus:** [What this specific visualization emphasizes about the location]

**Usage Context:** [Where/how this visualization would be used in documentation]

## Core Prompt
Hyperrealistic [perspective] of [LOCATION NAME], [brief location description]. [Architectural/geographical details]. [Environmental context]. [Time of day/lighting conditions]. [Weather/atmospheric conditions]. [Scale indicators]. [Activity/function indicators]. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, [specific perspective].

## Element Breakdown
- **Structure:** [Detailed description of primary architectural/geographical features]
- **Materials:** [Key materials, textures, and surface qualities]
- **Environment:** [Surrounding context, landscape, adjacent structures]
- **Scale:** [Elements that provide size reference]
- **Function:** [Visual indicators of the location's purpose/activity]
- **Distinctive Features:** [Unique or identifying elements specific to this location]
- **Lighting:** [Description of light source, quality, color temperature, and mood]
- **Perspective:** [Viewpoint, distance, angle]

## Variations
1. [Alternative time of day/lighting condition]
2. [Alternative weather/atmospheric condition]
3. [Alternative activity/functional state]
4. [Alternative season/temporal context]

# Turd Bird Headquarters (Modern Campus) - Aerial View
**Style:** Hyperrealistic digital art with architectural precision, cinematic lighting, atmospheric detail, corporate aesthetic with subtle hints of the unconventional

**Focus:** Overall campus layout showcasing the concentric ring design philosophy

**Usage Context:** Primary establishing visualization for headquarters architecture documentation

## Core Prompt
Hyperrealistic aerial view of Turd Bird Industries Headquarters, a sprawling 250-acre corporate campus in rural Connecticut. Distinctive concentric ring layout with progressively stranger architecture toward the center. Conventional corporate buildings in outer ring, specialized research facilities in middle ring, experimental structures with unconventional geometry in inner ring, and a central labyrinthine structure that appears to defy conventional architecture. Beautiful autumn day with late afternoon lighting casting long shadows. Campus surrounded by dense forest with single access road. Security perimeter visible but elegantly integrated into landscape design. 8K resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, three-quarter aerial perspective.

## Element Breakdown
- **Structure:** Concentric ring campus layout with five distinct circular zones, each ring containing different architectural styles becoming progressively more unconventional toward center, connected by spoke-like pathways and transportation systems
- **Materials:** Outer ring showing conventional glass and steel corporate architecture, middle ring featuring specialized materials and forms, inner ring displaying experimental surfaces with unusual properties, central structure appearing to shift and change even in still image
- **Environment:** Dense New England forest surrounding campus, creating natural security buffer, artificial lake to south side, controlled agricultural test fields to north, single winding access road with multiple security checkpoints
- **Scale:** 250-acre campus with buildings ranging from 1-37 stories, human figures and vehicles visible for scale reference, central "Labyrinth" structure approximately 100 meters in diameter
- **Function:** Research facilities with specialized external equipment visible, testing areas showing activity, transportation systems moving between rings, helipads with aircraft, shipping/receiving areas with activity
- **Distinctive Features:** Original lighthouse reconstructed near visitor center, water tower converted to observation post, "Verticality Tower" rising dramatically from middle ring, spherical "Nexus" structure suspended between supporting towers, central "Labyrinth" with non-standard geometry
- **Lighting:** Late afternoon autumn sunlight creating long dramatic shadows, emphasizing the three-dimensional quality of the campus layout, warm golden light contrasting with cooler shadows, subtle lighting effects visible from experimental inner ring
- **Perspective:** Three-quarter aerial view showing complete campus layout while providing sense of depth and scale, approximately 500 meters elevation

## Variations
1. Same view but at night with campus lighting systems active, showing distinctive illumination patterns
2. Same view but during winter with snow coverage highlighting architectural forms
3. Same view but during security lockdown with visible containment protocols active
4. Same view but showing underground facilities as partial cutaway
