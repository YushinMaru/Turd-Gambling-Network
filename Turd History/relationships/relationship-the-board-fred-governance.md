## Context
This document analyzes the complex, evolving relationship between The Board and Frederick "Fred" Werner Turd, detailing their power dynamics, conflicts, governance struggles, and mutual adaptation within Turd Bird Industries. This relationship represents a fundamental tension at the heart of the company's governance structure and connects to numerous essential narrative threads.

## Relationship Dynamics
