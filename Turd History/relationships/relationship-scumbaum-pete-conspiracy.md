- Began monitoring all of Pete's medical appointments and hospital stays
- Published "Death-Proof Executive" series with increasing viewership
- Pete began strategically allowing certain observations that fueled confusion
- Developed pattern of Scumbaum publishing increasingly outlandish theories
- Pete's genuine medical anomalies provided perfect foundation for conspiracy

#### The Reanimation Connection Era (2019-2021)
- Scumbaum discovered connection between Pete and ReAnimus Initiative
- Published "The Walking CEO" claiming Pete died permanently in 2018
- Developed theory that current Pete is reanimated corpse with consciousness preservation
- Began claiming all of Pete's pneumonia cases were cover for reanimation treatments
- Attempted multiple infiltrations of medical facilities treating Pete
- Pete began using Scumbaum's theories as cover for actual experimental treatments
- Relationship evolved into strange symbiosis of mutual utilization

#### The Zombie Immunity Phase (2021-Present)
- Pete's genuine zombie virus immunity discovery transformed dynamic
- Scumbaum's previous conspiracy theories accidentally aligned with reality
- Developed "Patient Zero" theory claiming Pete is source of zombie virus
- Currently focused on proving Pete is deliberately spreading condition
- Pete now actively using Scumbaum's conspiracies as distraction from actual research
- Current phase characterized by Scumbaum unknowingly approximating classified truth
- Both men locked in bizarre relationship where fiction and reality constantly interchange

## Tactical Approaches

### Scumbaum's Methods with Pete

#### Medical Surveillance
- Monitors all of Pete's scheduled medical appointments
- Maintains network of hospital contacts reporting Pete's admissions
- Collects discarded medical waste and materials for testing
- Photographs Pete at different stages of illness for comparison
- Attempts to obtain blood and tissue samples through deception
- Compiles detailed timeline of all pneumonia cases and treatments

#### Conspiracy Documentation
- Maintains elaborate wall chart connecting Pete's medical events
- Creates detailed anatomical diagrams of theorized modifications
- Compiles video evidence of Pete's physical changes over time
- Records all public appearances noting behavioral anomalies
- Tracks Pete's movements looking for treatment pattern evidence
- Analyzes speech patterns for evidence of consciousness transferrence

#### Harassment Techniques
- Ambushes Pete during acute illness phases for "evidence"
- Disguises self as medical personnel to access treatment rooms
- Publishes detailed medical conspiracy theories requiring response
- Confronts Pete with medical inconsistencies in public settings
- Attempts to provoke "inhuman" responses through specific triggers
- Directly challenges Pete to disprove immortality or reanimation

### Pete's Approaches with Scumbaum

#### Strategic Tolerance
- Maintains surprising accessibility during medical episodes
- Allows certain observations that perpetuate useful confusion
- Provides just enough medical access to fuel misinterpretation
- Responds to conspiracy theories with scientific explanations
- Occasionally reveals genuine medical anomalies in controlled fashion
- Strategically times medical events to coincide with company activities requiring distraction

#### Information Management
- Deliberately includes technical medical jargon Scumbaum will misinterpret
- Allows observation of genuine anomalies while controlling context
- Provides partial explanations that seem incomplete or suspicious
- Creates perception of attempted concealment around irrelevant details
- Maintains consistent explanations for genuinely unexplainable phenomena
- Ensures medical staff provide standardized responses to inquiries

#### Exploitation Techniques
- Uses Scumbaum's predictable focus to divert attention from sensitive operations
- Leverages conspiracy theories as cover for actual experimental treatments
- Employs Scumbaum as unintentional smokescreen for classified research
- Strategically "confirms" harmless conspiracies to discredit investigation broadly
- Creates deliberate medical inconsistencies to maintain Scumbaum's engagement
- Times specific medical revelations to align with corporate communication needs

## Functional Analysis
