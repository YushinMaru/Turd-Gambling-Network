## Context
This document outlines the evolving relationship between Frederick "Fred" Turd and Peter "Pneumonia Pete" Sebastian, which has transformed from mutual fascination to profound animosity. Their dynamic represents a central tension within Turd Bird Industries: the conflict between experimental innovation and impossible resilience.

## Content

### Initial Relationship: Mutual Fascination (2000)
Fred and Pete's relationship began when Pete volunteered for a dangerous Turd Bird experimental trial that other test subjects had refused. Their initial dynamic was characterized by mutual fascination:

- Fred viewed Pete as the ultimate test subject due to his extraordinary survival capabilities
- Pete saw Fred as a source of experimental treatments for his medical conditions
- Both shared a fundamental disregard for conventional limitations
- Each recognized in the other a complementary approach to mortality

This period established what one observer called "two disaster areas appreciating each other's destruction" – a relationship built on shared extremes rather than conventional connection.

### Evolution to Animosity (2000-2020)
The transition from fascination to animosity developed gradually through a series of escalating incidents:

1. **Increasingly Dangerous Testing**
   - Fred continuously pushed the boundaries of ethical experimentation
   - Pete's willingness to undergo risky procedures encouraged Fred's escalation
   - Each successful survival reinforced their pattern of mutual enablement
   - The ReAnimus Initiative represented the culmination of this experimental trajectory

2. **Power Dynamic Shift**
   - Pete's rise through Turd Bird ranks altered their relationship structure
   - Fred's authority was increasingly challenged by Pete's growing influence
   - Pete's survival of 80+ pneumonia cases earned him organizational respect
   - Fred began viewing Pete as a potential threat rather than a resource

3. **The Poisoned Coffee Incident**
   - The pivotal moment came when Pete was appointed CEO after Fred's temporary removal
   - On Pete's first day as CEO, Fred allegedly attempted to poison his coffee
   - Pete's detection and survival of the attempt created permanent distrust
   - Pete kept the poisoned cup as a reminder of Fred's betrayal

### Current Animosity (2020-Present)
Their current relationship is defined by:

- Fred really fucking hates Pete and makes no attempt to hide it
- Pete maintains extreme suspicion of Fred's every action and motive
- Fred's mansion features climate control set to freezing specifically to keep Pete out
- Pete's unique zombie virus immunity represents another survival Fred cannot replicate

Despite this animosity, they maintain a complex interdependence:
- Pete remains the only executive who can survive Fred's extreme methods
- Fred continues to view Pete as both test subject and existential challenge
- Their mutual opposition creates productive tension driving innovation
- Each represents to the other an unsolvable problem to be overcome
