## Context
This document reports on the successful completion of the task rotation process on May 7, 2025, following the completion of all active tasks. The rotation process has updated the active task queue with new priorities while maintaining proper documentation of completed work.

## Rotation Summary

### Completed Tasks
All previously active tasks have been completed and verified:

1. **Texas Theme Implementation (THEME-001)**
   - Updated visualization templates with Texas theme elements
   - Created implementation distinguishing authentic vs. affected Texas personas
   - Updated Fred Turd prompts and created Ellie Blande prompts

2. **AI Visualization Prompts (SORA-001 & SORA-002)**
   - Created five visualization prompts for The Truth AI
   - Created five visualization prompts for VANCE AI
   - Established consistent visual identity for both AI entities

3. **AI Entity Documentation (TIME-205, TIME-206, HIST-101, HIST-102)**
   - Documented key incidents involving The Truth and VANCE AI
   - Created origin stories for both AI entities
   - Established relationship dynamics between the AIs

### New Active Tasks
The following tasks have been rotated into the active queue:

1. **Automation System Tasks (HIGH Priority)**
   - AUTO-001: Create Quick Save Generation Script
   - AUTO-004: Implement Task Rotation Enforcement Script
   - AUTO-007: Implement Task-Save Integration Script

2. **AI Entity Integration (MEDIUM Priority)**
   - AI-INTG-001: Create AI Entity Interaction Framework

3. **Texas Theme Extension (LOW Priority)**
   - THEME-002: Develop Texas-Themed Corporate Events

### Registry Updates
The task registry has been updated to reflect all changes:

1. **Active Queue Tasks**
   - Five new tasks added to active queue
   - All previous active tasks moved to completed section

2. **Rotation History**
   - New rotation history section created
   - First rotation event documented with rationale

### Documentation Updated
The following documentation has been updated during the rotation process:

1. **Task Files**
   - `/tasks/current-tasks.md` updated with new active tasks
   - `/tasks/completed-tasks.md` updated with recently completed tasks
   - `/tasks/proposed-task-rotation-20250507.md` created as planning document
   - `/tasks/rotation-completion-20250507.md` created as this report

2. **Registry Files**
   - `/registry/task-registry.md` updated with new task locations and status
   - Registry version updated to 1.1.0 with expanded sections

## Implementation Approach

The rotation process followed this approach:

1. **Completion Verification**
   - Confirmed all previous tasks were fully completed and verified
   - Created comprehensive implementation summaries for all completed work

2. **Rotation Planning**
   - Analyzed available tasks in extended and automation task folders
   - Selected high-priority automation tasks for core functionality
   - Created new tasks for logical continuation of completed work
   - Documented rotation plan with rationale

3. **Registry Updates**
   - Updated task registry with new active queue
   - Created comprehensive completed tasks section
   - Added rotation history section
   - Updated references and version information

4. **Task Queue Update**
   - Updated current-tasks.md with new active tasks
   - Ensured detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria
   - Created clear dependency links to previous work

## System Status

The current system status following rotation:

1. **Active Queue**: 5 tasks (3 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 1 LOW priority)
2. **Line Count**: Current-tasks.md at 123 lines (well within 150-line limit)
3. **Domain Balance**: Good mix of automation and worldbuilding tasks
4. **Dependencies**: All dependencies for active tasks have been satisfied
5. **Registry**: Complete and up-to-date with all tasks properly tracked

## Next Steps

The recommended next steps for task implementation:

1. **Begin with AUTO-001** - Create Quick Save Generation Script
   - Highest priority automation task
   - Foundation for other automation tasks
   - Prerequisites already in place

2. **Parallel Planning for AI-INTG-001**
   - Begin conceptual framework development
   - Review AI entity documentation for integration opportunities
   - Plan implementation approach

3. **Schedule Regular Rotation Reviews**
   - Review active queue size with each task completion
   - Monitor progress on automation tasks
   - Prepare for next rotation when appropriate
