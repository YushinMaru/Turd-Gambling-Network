The verification ensures this character trait is portrayed with appropriate subtlety while maintaining its presence as a core element of Larry's psychological complexity.

## Verification Process

### Reference Collection
All references to Larry Bird's death wish toward Fred Turd were collected from across the Turd Bird Universe documentation:

| File Path | Reference Type | Context |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `/characters/larry-bird/_profile/attributes/character-larry-bird-attributes-personality.md` | Primary | Listed under "Internal Conflicts" as "Death Wish Conflict: Secretly wants Fred dead but won't acknowledge this desire" |
| `/Reference.md` | Core | Character profile section states "Secretly wants Fred dead but would never admit it or entertain the thought for longer than a second" |
| `/relationships/relationship-fred-larry-antagonism.md` | Relationship | Current relationship status includes "Larry secretly wanting Fred dead but never admitting it" |
| `/relationships/childhood/relationship-fred-larry-childhood-bullying.md` | Historical | "Larry's secret desire for Fred's death traced directly to childhood humiliations" |
| `/characters/fred-turd/_profile/character-fred-turd-overview.md` | Secondary | Key relationships section notes "Larry secretly wants Fred dead but won't admit it" |
| `/characters/larry-bird/career/phases/character-larry-bird-career-conflict-departure.md` | Behavioral | Influences strategic opposition and shadow infrastructure development |

### Consistency Analysis
The references were analyzed for consistency across the following dimensions:

1. **Acknowledgment Level:** All references consistently portray Larry as refusing to acknowledge the death wish
2. **Thought Duration:** References that mention duration consistently state "no longer than a second"
3. **Expression Style:** Consistently portrayed as deeply suppressed rather than overtly expressed
4. **Management Method:** Consistently described as immediately redirected into strategic thinking
5. **Contrast with Fred:** Consistently juxtaposed with Fred's open admission of wanting Larry dead
6. **Psychological Integration:** Consistently positioned as exception to Larry's otherwise rigid control

### Documentation Expansion
Based on the verification process, a comprehensive character trait documentation was created:
- `/characters/larry-bird/_profile/psychological/character-larry-bird-psychological-death-wish.md`

This document provides detailed analysis of:
- Psychological origins rooted in childhood trauma and bullying
- Manifestation patterns including triggers and physical indicators
- Emotional management strategies and containment protocols
- Narrative integration and contrasting expressions with Fred
- Post-departure evolution and strategic implications
- Canonical representation and language consistency guidelines

## Verification Results

### Established Canonical Elements
The following elements are consistently portrayed across all references and are established as canonical:

1. **Core Trait Definition**
   - Larry secretly wants Fred dead but refuses to acknowledge this desire
   - Larry will not entertain the thought for longer than one second
   - Larry immediately suppresses and redirects the thought when it surfaces
   - This represents Larry's sole departure from rigid self-control

2. **Psychological Mechanism**
   - Manifests as intrusive thought rather than active desire
   - Functions as psychological pressure valve within rigid control system
   - Immediately contained through intellectualization and compartmentalization
   - Redirected into strategic corporate maneuvers and opposition

3. **Origins and Development**
   - Rooted in systematic childhood bullying (1969-1976)
   - Deepened through professional antagonism and boundary violations
   - Crystallized during "The Thursday Incident" (2015)
   - Potentially evolved into strategic element post-departure (2023)

4. **Contrasting Expressions**
   - Fred openly admits wanting Larry dead and dreams about it nightly
   - Larry absolutely denies and suppresses identical desire toward Fred
   - This contrast highlights fundamental personality differences
   - Creates powerful narrative tension through parallel but opposed traits

### Resolved Inconsistencies
No significant inconsistencies were found in the portrayal of this character trait across documentation. Minor variations in phrasing have been standardized through the canonical documentation.

## Future Narrative Considerations

### Potential Development Paths
While maintaining consistent portrayal of this trait, the following development paths offer narrative potential:

1. **Evolution in Absentia**
   - Larry's departure may allow evolution of this suppressed trait
   - Potential integration into strategic planning against Fred
   - Possible transformation from emotional response to calculated element

2. **Trigger Event Exploration**
   - Further exploration of specific trigger events that surface this trait
   - Potential for revealing moments of control failure under extreme provocation
   - Examination of psychological cost of maintaining suppression

3. **Contrast Enhancement**
   - Further development of parallel but opposed traits between Fred and Larry
   - Exploration of how identical desires with different expressions shape actions
   - Potential for narrative moments highlighting this fundamental contrast

### Narrative Guardrails
To maintain trait integrity, the following narrative boundaries should be observed:

1. **Acknowledgment Boundary**
   - Larry should never overtly acknowledge or admit this desire
   - Any verbalization would contradict core character integrity
   - Maintain as internal, deeply suppressed trait

2. **Action Boundary**
   - Larry should never take direct harmful action against Fred
   - Strategic opposition must remain professional and corporate
   - Maintain ethical boundary between thought and action

3. **Duration Boundary**
   - Conscious consideration should never exceed one second
   - Immediate suppression must follow any emergence of the thought
   - Maintain consistency with established psychological pattern
