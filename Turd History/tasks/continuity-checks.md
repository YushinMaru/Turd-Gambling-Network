## Worldbuilding Consistency Verification

### [CONT-006] - Verify Consistency of Fred's Zombie-Proof Mansion
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** WORLDBUILDING
**Status:** COMPLETED+VERIFIED

This temperature, symbolically matching the poisoned coffee temperature from the January 2020 Coffee Poisoning Incident, is consistently maintained across all documentation. The verification also confirmed construction timeline consistency (mansion built 2010-2015, moat added December 2018, current configuration 2020-Present), integration with the ReAnimus research program, and comprehensive Pete-specific countermeasures. The mansion effectively serves as a physical manifestation of the Fred-Pete relationship, with the freezing moat temperature providing a powerful symbolic connection to the pivotal coffee poisoning incident.
